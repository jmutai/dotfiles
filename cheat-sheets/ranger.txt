    l or E = Open file (opens file in default file-handler)
    r = Open file with… (allows you to choose program to use)
    o = Change sort order (follow by character in menu selection)
    z = Change settings (commonly used toggle settings)
    zh = View hidden files
    <space> = Select current file
    t = Tag file (you can perform actions on tagged files)
    cw = Rename current file
    / = Search for files
    n = Jump to next match
    N = Jump to previous match
    yy = Yank (copy) file
    dd = Mark file for cut operation
    <delete> = Delete selected file

Tabbed Browsing


    <ctrl>-n = Create new tab
    <ctrl>-w = Close current tab
    <tab> = Next tab
    <shift><tab> = Previous tab

General Commands

    ? = View ranger man page
    1? = Keybindings help
    2? = Command help
    3? = Settings help
    R = Reload current directory
    Q = Quit

Command Interface

    ! = Execute a command from the shell (non-ranger commands)
    : = Execute a ranger command
    du = Measure disk usage of current directory
    chmod = Change permissions of current file
There are a number of flags that you can pass to commands to modify the operation of the commands. They should be used with a dash "-" after typing "!" for shell commands or ":" for ranger commands:

    -s = Discard the output of the current command.
    -d = Detach the process and run in the background
    -p = Return the output in ranger's file pager
    -w = Do not return immediately after command execution. Hang until "Enter" is pressed
    -c = Perform command on current file, not the selected files
Ranger also allows you to target specific files by substituting groups of files for command operations. It accomplishes that by using placeholders that will be expanded with the correct files upon execution:

    %f = Substitute highlighted file
    %d = Substitute current directory
    %s = Substitute currently selected files
    %t = Substitute currently tagged files

For example, if we wanted to change the names of multiple files, we could select them all with the space bar. After that, we can type:
:bulkrename %s
