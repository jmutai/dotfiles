Configuring Network Teaming
Network Teaming

    Links NICs together logically

        Allows for failover or higher throughput

        New alternative to bonding driver in Linux kernel

        Supports channel bonding for backward compatibility

        Modular design increases performance and extensibility

    Implemented with small kernel driver and teamd user-space daemon

        Kernel handles network packets

        teamd handles logic and interface processing

    Implements load-balancing and active-backup logic with runners

        Example: roundrobin

Configuring Network Teaming

broadcast
    

Simple runner that transmits each packet from all ports

roundrobin
    

Simple runner that transmits packets in round-robin fashion from each port

activebackup
    

Failover runner that watches for link changes and selects active port for data transfers

loadbalance
    

Load-balancing runner that monitors traffic and uses hash function to select ports for packet transmission

lacp
    

Implements 802.3ad Link Aggregation Control Protocol (can use same transmit port selection possibilities as loadbalance)

Team Interface

    All network interaction occurs through team interface composed of multiple port interfaces

    Note following when using NetworkManager to control teamed port interfaces:

        Starting network team interface does not automatically start port interfaces

        Starting port interface always starts teamed interface

        Stopping teamed interface also stops port interfaces

        Teamed interface without ports can start static IP connections

        Team without ports waits for ports when starting DHCP connections

        Team with DHCP connection waiting for ports completes when port with carrier is added

        Team with DHCP connection waiting for ports continues waiting when port without carrier is added


Configuring Network Teams

    To create and manage team and port interfaces, use nmcli

    To create and activate network team interface:

        Create team interface

        Determine IPv4 and/or IPv6 attributes of team interface

        Assign port interfaces

        Bring team and port interfaces up/down

Creating Team Interface

    To create connection for network team interface, use nmcli

    nmcli con add type team con-name CNAME ifname INAME [config JSON]

        CNAME is the connection name

        INAME is interface name

        JSON specifies runner to use

    JSON has following syntax:

    '{"runner": {"name": "METHOD"}}'

        METHOD valid options are broadcast, roundrobin, activebackup, loadbalance, or lacp

    [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add type team con-name team0 ifname team0 config '{"runner": {"name": "loadbalance"}}'


Determining IPv4/IPv6 Attributes

    After creating network team interface, assign IPv4 and/or IPv6 attributes

        Optional if DHCP is available

        Example: Assign static IPv4 address to the team0 interface

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con mod team0 ipv4.addresses 1.2.3.4/24
        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con mod team0 ipv4.method manual

        Assign ipv4.addresses before setting ipv4.method to manual

Assigning Port Interfaces

    To create port interface, use nmcli

    nmcli con add type team-slave con-name CNAME ifname INAME master TEAM

        CNAME is port name

        INAME is name of existing interface

        TEAM specifies connection name of network team interface

            Can specify connection name or use default: team-slave-IFACE

            [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add type team-slave ifname eth1 master team0
            [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add type team-slave ifname eth2 master team0 con-name team0-eth2

Bringing Interfaces Up/Down

    To manage connections for team and port interfaces, use nmcli with following syntax:

    nmcli dev dis INAME
    nmcli con up CNAME

        INAME is device name of team or port interface to be managed

        CNAME is connection name of that interface

        [root@demo ~]# nmcli con up team0
        [root@demo ~]# nmcli dev dis eth2

o display state of team interface when it is up, use teamdctl

[root@demo ~]# teamdctl team0 state


Network Teaming Configuration Files

    NetworkManager creates teaming configuration files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

    Creates file for each interface: team and each port

    Team interface file defines IP settings for interface

    DEVICETYPE defines this as network team interface

    TEAM_CONFIG defines teamd configuration parameters

        Uses JSON syntax

        # /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-team0
        DEVICE=team0
        DEVICETYPE=Team
        TEAM_CONFIG="{\"runner\": {\"name\": \"broadcast\"}}"
        BOOTPROTO=none
        IPADDR0=192.168.0.1
        PREFIX0=24
        NAME=team0
        ONBOOT=yes


    Example: Configure file for team port interface

    # /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-team0-eth1
    DEVICE=eth1
    DEVICETYPE=TeamPort
    TEAM_MASTER=team0
    NAME=team0-eth1
    ONBOOT=yes

    DEVICETYPE defines this as team port interface

    TEAM_MASTER specifies team device associated with port

Setting and Adjusting Team Configuration

    Initial network team configuration is set when creating team interface

    Default runner is roundrobin

        Can specify different runner with JSON string when team is created with team.config

        When not specified, default values for runner parameters are used

    To assign different runner or adjust runner parameters, use nmcli con mod

        For simple configuration changes, use JSON string

        For complex changes, refer to file with JSON configuration

        nmcli con mod IFACE team.config JSON-configuration-file-or-string


# cat /tmp/team.conf

link-watch Settings

    Determine how link state of port interfaces are monitored

    Default settings use functionality similar to ethtool to check link of each interface

    "link_watch": {
        "name": "ethtool"
    }

    Can also check link state and remote connectivity with arp_ping

        Must specify local and remote IP addresses and timeouts

    "link_watch":{
        "name": "arp_ping",
        "interval": 100,
        "missed_max": 30,
        "source_host": "192.168.23.2",
        "target_host": "192.168.23.1"
    },


Troubleshooting Network Teams

    Use teamnl and teamdctl to troubleshoot network teams that are up

    To display team ports of team0 interface:

    [root@demo ~]# teamnl team0 ports
     4: eth2: up 0Mbit HD
     3: eth1: up 0Mbit HD

    To display currently active port of team0:

    [root@demo ~]# teamnl team0 getoption activeport
    3

    To set option for active port of team0:

    [root@demo ~]# teamnl team0 setoption activeport 3

To display current state of team0 interface, use teamdctl

[root@demo ~]# teamdctl team0 state

To display current JSON configuration for team0, use teamdctl

[root@demo ~]# teamdctl team0 config dump

Software Bridges

    Network bridge: Link-layer device that forwards traffic between networks based on MAC addresses

        Learns what hosts are connected to each network

        Builds table of MAC addresses

        Makes packet-forwarding decisions based on table

    Software bridge can emulate hardware bridge

    Commonly used in virtualization applications

        Shares hardware NIC among virtual NICs


Configuring Software Bridges

    To configure persistent software bridges, use nmcli

    Create software bridge, then connect interfaces to it

    Example: Create bridge called br0 and attach eth1 and eth2 interfaces to it

    [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add type bridge con-name br0 ifname br0
    [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add type bridge-slave con-name br0-port1 ifname eth1 master br0
    [root@demo ~]# nmcli con add type bridge-slave con-name br0-port2 ifname eth2 master br0

    NetworkManager can attach only Ethernet interfaces to bridge

        Does not support aggregate interfaces, such as teamed or bonded interfaces

        Configure aggregate interfaces manually in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

Software Bridge Configuration Files

    Software bridges managed by interface configuration files in /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts

    Each software bridge has ifcfg-* file

    # /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br1
    DEVICE=br1
    NAME=br1
    TYPE=Bridge
    BOOTPROTO=none
    IPADDR0=192.168.0.1
    PREFIX0=24
    STP=yes
    BRIDGING_OPTS=priority=32768

    TYPE=Bridge specifies software bridge

    BRIDGING_OPTS defines additional bridge options

    Example: Attach Ethernet interface to software bridge

    # /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-br1-port0
    TYPE=Ethernet
    NAME=br1-port0
    DEVICE=eth1
    ONBOOT=yes
    BRIDGE=br1

    BRIDGE=br1 ties interface to software bridge br1

Configuring Software Bridges

    To implement software bridge on existing teamed or bonded network interface managed by NetworkManager, disable NetworkManager

        Create configuration files for bridge manually

        To manage software bridge and other network interfaces, use ifup and ifdown

    To display software bridges and list the interfaces attached to them, use brctl show

    [root@demo ~]# brctl show
    bridge name     bridge id               STP enabled     interfaces
    br1             8000.52540001050b       yes             eth1
