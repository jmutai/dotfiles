Domain Name System
    Domain Name System (DNS): Hierarchical naming system

        Serves as directory of networked hosts and resources

    Information in directory:

        Maps network names to data

        Maintained in logical entries called resource records

    DNS hierarchy:

        Begins with root domain . at top

        Branches downward to next-level domains

    Each level of DNS hierarchy delineated by .

        Top level: .

        Second level: com, net, org

        Third level: example.com, redhat.com


Domain

    Collection of resource records that:

        Ends in common name

        Represents entire subtree of DNS name space: example.com

    Largest possible domain is root domain, .

        Includes entire DNS namespace

    Top-level domain (TLD) has only one component

        Generic TLDs (gTLDs) organized by theme

            Include .com, .edu, .net, etc.

        Country code TLDs (ccTLDs) organized on national basis

            Include .us, .uk, .cn, .ru, etc.


Subdomain

    Domain that is subtree of another domain

    Use when discussing relationship of two domains to each other

        Example: lab.example.com is subdomain of example.com

Zone

    Portion of domain for which nameserver is directly responsible (authoritative)

    May be entire domain or part of domain with some or all subdomains delegated to other nameserver(s)


Anatomy of DNS Lookups

    When system needs to perform name resolution using DNS server:

        Sends queries to servers listed in /etc/resolv.conf in order

        Sends until it gets response or runs out of servers

    To manually look up DNS name, use host or dig

Local Authoritative Data

    When query arrives at DNS server:

        Server determines whether queried information resides in zone it is authoritative for

        If yes, server responds to client with information contained in local zone file

        Server providing response is authoritative for data provided, called authoritative answer (aa)

        Authoritative answers from nameserver have aa flag in header of DNS response


Local Cached Non-Authoritative Data

    If DNS server is not authority for record but obtained record to answer previous query:

        May have copy of record in cache

            Cache is where answers to queries stored for time specified in resource record response value Time To Live (TTL)

    If answer exists in cache, server provides it to client

        Answer does not have aa flag because server is not authoritative for data being provided

Remote Non-Authoritative Data via Recursion

    If DNS server not authoritative for name being queried and does not possess record in cache:

        Attempts to retrieve record via recursion

        DNS server with empty cache begins querying one root nameserver by IP address retrieved from local, pre-populated root hints file

        Root nameserver responds with referral to nameservers authoritative for TLD containing queried name

    After receiving referral:

        DNS server performs query to TLD authoritative nameserver

        Authoritative nameserver sends either authoritative answer or another referral

        Process continues until authoritative server is reached and responds with authoritative answer

    DNS server caches final answer and any intermediate answers to improve performance

        Example: During www.example.com lookup:

            DNS server finds example.com zone has authoritative nameservers

            DNS server queries those servers directly for future queries in example.com zone

DNS Resource Records

    DNS resource records (RRs): Entries in DNS zone that specify information about particular name or object

    Contains type, TTL, class, and data elements

    RR uses this format:

    owner-name           TTL      class      type     data
    www.example.com.     300      IN         A        192.168.1.10

owner-name
    

Name for resource record

TTL
    

Time To Live of resource record in seconds—specifies how long DNS resolves should cache resource record

class
    

"Class" of record, almost always IN ("Internet")

type
    

Sort of information stored by this record—for example, A record maps host name to aIPv4 address

data
    

Data stored by record; exact format varies by record type

 Resource Records
A (IPv4 Address) Record

    Maps host name to IPv4 address

    [student@server1 ~]$ host -v -t A example.com
    Trying "example.com"

AAAA (IPv6 Address or "Quad-A") Record

    Maps host name to IPv6 address

    [student@server1 ~]$ host -v -t AAAA a.root-servers.net
    Trying "a.root-servers.net"
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 18194

    Received 64 bytes from 192.168.0.254#53 in 78 ms

CNAME (Canoncial Name) Record

    Aliases one name to another name (canonical name)

        Should have A or AAAA records

    DNS resolver receives CNAME record as query response

        Reissues query using canonical name instead of original name

    Data field of CNAME records can point to name anywhere in DNS

        Internal or external to zone:

        www-dev.example.com. IN CNAME lab.example.com.
        www.example.com.     IN CNAME www.redhat.com.

    Use CNAME records with care.

    Avoid pointing CNAME record to other CNAME records

    Chain of CNAME record must end in A and/or AAAA records

    Legitimate uses for CNAME chains:

        When using Content Delivery Networks (CDNs) to improve speed and reliability of data delivery over Internet

    Point NS and MX records at names with A and/or AAAA records

        Do not point NS and MX at CNAME records

        [student@server1 ~]$ host -v -t A ipa-ca.server0.example.com
        Trying "ipa-ca.server0.example.com"
        ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 11931

PTR (Pointer) Record

    Maps IPv4 or IPv6 addresses to host name

        Used for reverse DNS resolution

    PTR records code IP address in special format that acts like host name

        IPv4 addresses: Address reversed, result treated as host in subdomain of domain in-addr.arpa

        IPv6 addresses: Address split into subdomains on nibble boundaries, set up as subdomain of domain ip6.arpa

    Syntax enables DNS administrators to delegate responsibility for ranges of addresses to other DNS administrators

    Example: PTR with IPv4 address

    [student@server1 ~]$ host -v -t PTR 192.168.0.1
    Trying "1.0.168.192.in-addr.arpa"
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 36389

 (Name Server) Record

    Maps domain name to DNS name server authoritative for DNS zone

    Every public authoritative name server for zone must have NS record

    [student@server1 ~]$ host -v -t NS example.com
    Trying "example.com"
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 29362

    Received 80 bytes from 192.168.0.254#53 in 0 ms



SOA (Start of Authority) Record

    Provides information about how DNS zone works

    One SOA record for zone

    Specifies:

        Which of zone’s name servers is primary (master)

        Information on how secondary (slave) name servers should update their information

        Zone’s management contact


Master nameserver
    

Host name of nameserver that is original source of domain information and can accept dynamic DNS updates if zone supports them

RNAME
    

    Email address of person responsible for DNS zone (hostmaster)

    The @ in email address is replaced with a . in RNAME

        Example: Email address hostmaster@example.com written as hostmaster.example.com

Serial number
    

Version number of zone, increased when there change occurs to zone records

Refresh
    

How frequently slave servers should check for zone updates, in seconds

Retry
    

How long slave server should wait before retrying failed refresh attempt, in seconds

Expiry
    

If refreshes have been failing, how long slave server should wait before it stops using its old copy of zone to respond to queries, in seconds

Minimum
    

If resolver looks up name that does not exist (gets a nonexistent domain (NXDOMAIN) response), how long it should cache information that record does not exist, in seconds


    Example: SOA syntax

MX (Mail Exchange) Record

    Maps domain name to mail exchange that accepts email for name

    Data includes:

        Preference number (lowest preferred) to determine order in which to pick between multiple MX records

        Host name for mail exchange for that name

        [student@server1 ~]$ host -v -t MX example.com

TXT (Text) Record

    Maps name to arbitrary human-readable text

    Commonly used to supply data used by:

        Sender Policy Framework (SPF)

        DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM)

        Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC)

        Etc.

SRV (Service) Record

    Used to locate hosts that support service for domain

    Using _service.protocol.domainname_, SRV records:

        Provide names of hosts that provide service for domain

        Provide port number that service listens on

        Include priority and weight values to indicate order to use hosts when multiple hosts are available for service

            Maps host name to IP addresses

        PTR record for each IP address

            Reverse maps them to host name

        Optionally, one or more CNAME records

            Maps alternate names to canonical host name

    Typical DNS zone has following records (in addition to records for hosts in zone):

Caching Nameservers

    Store DNS query results in local cache

    Remove resource records from cache when TTLs expire

    Can set up caching nameservers to perform queries on behalf of clients on local network

        Improves efficiency of DNS name resolutions

            Reduces DNS traffic across Internet

        As cache grows, DNS performance improves

            Nameserver answers more client queries from local cache


DNSSEC Validation

    DNS transactions prone to spoofing and tampering

    Caching nameservers targets of attackers looking to redirect/hijack network traffic

        Often achieve this by fooling DNS server into populating malicious data into cache: cache poisoning

        Lets attacker compromise DNS data received by clients utilizing caching name service on DNS server and then redirect/hijack clients' network traffic

    Caching nameservers perform Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) validation to improve security

        Lets caching nameserver validate authenticity/integrity of resource records before placing them in cache

        Protects clients against consequences of cache poisoning


    As root, install unbound:

    [root@server1 ~]# yum install -y unbound

    Start and enable unbound.service:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl start unbound.service
    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl enable unbound.service
    ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/unbound.service' '/etc/systemd/system/multi-user.target.wants/unbound.service'

    Configure network interface to listen on:

        unbound listens on localhost only by default

        To make unbound available to remote clients as caching nameserver, use interface

            Specify network interface(s) to listen on

            0.0.0.0 configures unbound to listen on all network interfaces

            interface: 0.0.0.0


Configuring unbound

    Configure client access:

        unbound refuses recursive queries from all clients by default

        To specify clients allowed to make recursive queries, use access-control

        access-control: 192.168.0.0/24 allow

    Configure forwarding:

        To specify DNS server(s) to forward queries to, create forward-zone clause

        To specify DNS servers by:

            Host name, use forward-host

            IP address, use forward-addr

        To forward all queries, use . for forward-zone

        forward-zone:
        name: "."
        forward-addr: 192.168.0.254

    Bypass DNSSEC validation for select unsigned zones:

        unbound performs DNSSEC validation to verify all DNS responses received by default

            To specify domain for which DNSSEC validation should be skipped, use domain-insecure

            Often desirable with unsigned internal domain that would fail trust chain validation

            domain-insecure: example.com

    Install trust anchors for signed zones without complete chain of trust:

        Not all ccTLDs have completed implementation of DNSSEC

            Subdomains of these ccTLDs can be DNSSEC-signed but have broken chain of trust

        To specify trust anchor for zone, use trust-anchor

        To obtain DNSKEY record for key signing key (KSK) of zone, use dig and input it as trust-anchor value

        [student@server1 ~]$ dig +dnssec DNSKEY example.com

        trust-anchor: "example.com. 3600 IN DNSKEY 257 3 8 AwEAAawt7HplI5M8GGAsxuyCyjF0l+QlcgVN11CRZ4vP66qbDCX0BnSh Z11BGb//4zSG/8mmBHirL2FLg+mVuIIxig+iroZYjh4iTKVOhv2hZftR wyrQHK++qXvCCWN3ki51RG/e8R4kOEV71rZ8OgQvPWx6F91qroqOPpcf 7PPxippeHOn+PxnP0hpyLyo1mx1rPs/cMpL3jOMufGP+LJYh+fBU7lt0 sP5i09HaJPruzyZML9BPtpv8ZAdQhwtXVG0+MnET2qT/1+TljpxZn6ye egFRCFRHBjMo6iiRJnUWra/klkrgEn2Q+BXGTOMTTKQdYz4OxYEa1z7a pu3a09dYNBM="


    Save changes to /etc/unbound/unbound.conf

    Check /etc/unbound/unbound.conf for syntax errors:

    [root@server1 ~]# unbound-checkconf
    unbound-checkconf: no errors in /etc/unbound/unbound.conf

    Restart unbound.service:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl restart unbound.service

    Configure firewall to allow DNS traffic:

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=dns
    success
    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
    success



Dumping and Loading unbound Cache

    Need to dump cache data when troubleshooting DNS issues

    To dump cache with unbound, use unbound-control with dump_cache:

    [root@server1 ~]# unbound-control dump_cache
    START_RRSET_CACHE
    ;rrset 86395 1 0 3 3
    classroom.example.com.  86395   IN  A   192.168.0.254
    ;rrset 86395 1 0 7 3
    example.com.    86395   IN  NS  classroom.example.com.
    ;rrset 86395 1 0 8 3
    example.com.    86395   IN  A   192.168.0.254
    END_RRSET_CACHE
    START_MSG_CACHE
    msg example.com. IN A 33152 1 86395 3 1 1 1
    example.com. IN A 0
    example.com. IN NS 0
    classroom.example.com. IN A 0
    END_MSG_CACHE
    EOF

    This dumps cache to stdout in text format

    Can direct output to file for storage

    To read from stdin and load back into cache, use unbound-control load_cache:

    [root@server1 ~]# unbound-control load_cache < dump.out
    ok


Flushing unbound Cache

    Periodically purge outdated resource records from cache

        Erroneous/outdated resource records prevent newly corrected counterparts from becoming available to clients until TTLs expire

    To purge outdated records from cache, use unbound-control with flush:

    [root@server1 ~]# unbound-control flush www.example.com
    ok

    To purge all resource records belonging to domain from cache, use unbound-control with flush_zone:

    [root@server1 ~]# unbound-control flush_zone example.com
    ok removed 3 rrsets, 1 messages and 0 key entries



Updating Local Caching unbound Configuration With dnssec-trigger

    Can use unbound as local caching nameserver

        Provides secure DNS name resolution for local use on individual system

    For local caching nameserver setup, point nameserver to localhost where unbound is listening

    unbound configuration forwards DNS requests to upstream nameservers and validates responses

    For DHCP systems running local caching name service, upstream nameservers specified in unbound configuration may become outdated

    To automatically update forwarder settings in unbound configuration file to point to new DNS servers, use dnssec-trigger

        Using dnssec-trigger with unbound helps secure DNS name resolution on roaming client machines


Troubleshooting DNS

    DNS name resolution depends on proper configuration/operation of DNS on:

        System

        Resolving nameserver

        Authoritative nameservers used to resolve DNS requests

    Recursive name resolution involves interactions with many different authoritative nameservers

        Creates many possible points for failure

    Caching nameservers reduce DNS workloads and improve DNS performance

        Caching function adds another point of failure

        Creates scenarios where DNS responses received by clients are inaccurate because data is no longer current

    Must be able to quickly resolve DNS issues to minimize service interruptions

    Key to DNS troubleshooting is pinpointing which point in client-server interactions is responsible for unexpected behavior

    Requires proper tools and understanding diagnostic data they provide

    Domain Internet Groper (dig) is good tool for investigating DNS issues


Name Resolution Methods

    DNS service often bears blame for unexpected name resolution results

    Name resolution on networked hosts can occur via other methods:

        Local hosts files

        Windows Internet Name Service (WINS)

        Etc.

    By default, Linux attempts name resolution with /etc/hosts

        Resolves based on order in /etc/nsswitch.conf

    Do not assume issue resides with DNS

        First identify which name resolution mechanism is in play


    To perform name resolution, use getent from glibc-common package or gethostip from syslinux package

        Mirrors process used by applications in following order of host name resolution as dictated by /etc/nsswitch.conf

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ getent hosts example.com
        192.168.0.254  example.com

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ gethostip example.com
        example.com 192.168.0.254 AC19FEFE

    If getent or gethostip result differs from dig result, something besides DNS is responsible

    Consult /etc/nsswitch.conf to determine other name resolution mechanisms employed before DNS


Client/Server Network Connectivity

    For proper DNS name resolution, system must conduct client/server interactions with resolving nameserver or authoritative nameservers

    Common DNS issues at this layer result from resolver and firewall misconfigurations

    When using dig to troubleshoot issue:

        If no response received from DNS server, cause lies with client/server network connectivity to DNS server

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ dig A example.com
        ; <<>> DiG 9.9.4-RedHat-9.9.4-14.el7 <<>> A example.com
        ;; global options: +cmd
        ;; connection timed out; no servers could be reached

    Possible cause: Inability to reach DNS server due to incorrect DNS server IP address(es) in DNS configuration

        If system acts as DNS client, check /etc/resolv.conf

        If system is configured as unbound caching nameserver, check forward-zone clause of /etc/unbound/unbound.conf


Firewall Rules

    Another possible cause: Firewall rules on client or server system blocking DNS traffic on port 53

        DNS mostly uses UDP protocol

        When response data sizes exceed 512 bytes, resolvers use TCP to retry query

            Or responses exceed 4096 bytes for DNS servers that support EDNS

        DNS configuration should allow for DNS traffic on port 53 for UDP and TCP

        Allowing port 53 traffic for UDP only results in truncation error if resolver encounters response larger than it can handle over UDP

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ dig @server1.example.com.example.com A labhost1.example.com
        ;; Truncated, retrying in TCP mode.
        ;; Connection to 192.168.0.101#53(192.168.0.101) for labhost1.example.com failed:
        host unreachable.


dig

    To troubleshoot whether DNS queries can succeed with TCP, use dig's tcp or vc options

        Force dig to use TCP regardless of response size

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ dig +tcp A example.com

    For DNS issues at network layer, dig provides sparse output

        Often useful to also use network packet analyzer such as tcpdump to determine what is transpiring at network layer

        tcpdump lets you determine information such as:

            Destination IP address of DNS request

            If request packets leave client

            If request packets reach server

            If response packets leave server

            If response packets reach client

DNS Response Codes

    If DNS client/server communication successful, dig generates output detailing nature of response received from DNS server

    status field in HEADER section reports response code generated by DNS server

    [student@desktop1 ~]$ dig A example.com
    ; <<>> DiG 9.9.4-RedHat-9.9.4-14.el7 <<>> A example.com
    ;; global options: +cmd
    ;; Got answer:
    ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 30523
    ...

    NOERROR status indicates query was resolved successfully

    If server encounters problems fulfilling query, error status is displayed:

SERVFAIL
    

Nameserver encountered problem while processing query

NXDOMAIN
    

Queried name does not exist in zone

REFUSED
    

Nameserver refused client’s DNS request due to policy restrictions.

SERVFAIL

    Common cause of SERVFAIL is failure of DNS server to communicate with authoritative nameservers for queried name

    May be due to:

        Authoritative nameservers being unavailable

        Problem at network layer interfering with client/server communication between DNS server and nameservers

            Examples: Metwork routing issues or firewall rules at network path hop

    To determine cause for SERVFAIL, determine which nameserver communication is causing failure

    To see results of nameserver’s iterative queries starting with root nameservers, use dig's +trace option

NXDOMAIN

    NXDOMAIN indicates no records were found associated with name queried

    If result is not expected result and query is directed at server not authoritative for name, server’s cache may contain negative cache for name

    Can either:

        Wait for server to expire negative cache of name

        Submit request to server administrator to flush name from cache

        After name removed from cache, server queries authoritative nameserver to receive current resource records for name

    NXDOMAIN may also occur when querying CNAME record containing orphaned CNAME

    Name on right side of CNAME record should point to name containing A or AAAA records

    If records are nonexistent or removed, canonical name in CNAME is orphaned

        Queries for owner name in CNAME record no longer resolvable and result in NXDOMAIN

REFUSED

    REFUSED indicates DNS server has policy restriction that keeps it from fulfilling client’s query

    Policy restrictions often implemented to restrict clients that can make recursive queries and zone transfer requests

    Common causes of unexpected REFUSED status:

        Clients configured to query wrong DNS servers

        DNS server misconfiguration causing valid client requests to be refused


Other Common DNS Issues
Outdated Cached Data

    NOERROR signifies no errors in resolving query

        Does not guarantee no DNS issues present

    DNS records in DNS response may not match expected result

        Common cause: Answer originated from outdated cached data

    To if response is authoritative cached data, review dig output

        Authoritative answers have aa flag:

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ dig A example.com
        ; <<>> DiG 9.9.4-RedHat-9.9.4-14.el7 <<>> A example.com
        ;; global options: +cmd
        ;; Got answer:
        ;; ->>HEADER<<- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 22257
        ;; flags: qr aa rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 1, AUTHORITY: 1, ADDITIONAL: 2

    Other sign that answer is coming from cache is counting down resource record TTL value in responses of each subsequent query

        TTLs of cached data count down to expiration
        TTLs of authoritative data remain static




Responses for Nonexistent Records

    If record was removed from zone but response still received when querying for record:

        Confirm queries not being answered from cached data

        If aa flag is present in dig output, wildcard (*) record may be present in zone:

        *.example.com. IN A 192.168.0.254

    Wildcard record serves as catchall for all queries of given type for nonexistent name

    With wildcard record in place:

        If A record existed for server1.example.com.example.com and is removed

        Queries for name succeed and IP address in wildcard A record is provided


Non-FQDN Name Errors

    In zone file, host names not expressed as Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) automatically expand to FQDNs by appending zone name

    To indicate that name is FQDN in zone file, name must end in . (www.example.com.)

    Not doing so can lead to different issues depending on record type

        Mistake in type-specific data portion of NS records can incapacitate entire zone

        Mistake in MX records can halt email delivery for domain


Looping CNAME Records

    Avoid CNAME records that point to CNAME records

        Reduces DNS lookup inefficiency

        Possibly creates unresolvable CNAME loops:

        test.example.com. IN CNAME lab.example.com.
        lab.example.com.  IN CNAME test.example.com.

    CNAME record with orphaned CNAME results in NXDOMAIN status

    Looping CNAME records return NOERROR


Missing PTR Records

    Network services use DNS to perform reverse lookups of incoming client connections

    Absence of PTR records in DNS may result in different issues depending on service:

        SSHD performs reverse lookups of connecting client IPs

            Absence of PTR records leads to delays in establishing connections

        MTAs incorporate reverse DNS lookups of connecting client IPs as defense against malicious email clients

        Many MTAs configured to reject client connections for IPs

            Cannot be resolved with PTR query in DNS

    Understand requirements network services have for forward and reverse DNS lookups


Round-Robin DNS

    Round-robin DNS: Name has multiple A or AAAA records in DNS

        Simple, low-cost, load-balancing mechanism to distribute network resource loads across multiple hosts

    When DNS client queries name containing multiple A/AAAA records, all records return as a set

        Record order in set permutates for each query

        Clients normally use first address in set

        Variation in record order results in distribution of network service across IP addresses

    Can inadvertently create round-robin DNS configuration

        If request to change IP address of A record is mistakenly implemented as resource record addition instead of resource record modification

If network resources on old IP address are retired, load distribution effect of round-robin DNS results in service failures for half of clients
