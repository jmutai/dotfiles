Bash Shell Scripting Basics

    Simple system administration tasks can be accomplished with Linux command-line tools

    More complex tasks require chaining multiple commands

        Command line tools can be combined with Bash shell to create powerful shell scripts

    Bash shell script is executable file composed of list of commands

        Can be further leveraged by other scripts

    Proficiency in shell scripting is essential to Linux system administration

        Especially crucial in enterprise environments

        Shell scripts can improve efficiency and accuracy of routine tasks


Choosing a Programming Language

    Bash shell scripting not right tool for all scenarios

    Programming languages have strengths and weaknesses; none is right for every situation

    Bash scripts are good for tasks that can be accomplished mainly by calling other command line utilities

        If task involves heavy data processing and manipulation, languages such as Perl or Python are better

    Bash supports arithmetic operations limited to simple integer arithmetic

        For more complex arithmetic operations, consider C or C++

    Bash supports 1D and associative arrays, but Perl and Python have better array functionality

    Gain experience with shell scripting and programming languages to learn advantages and disadvantages of each


Creating Bash Shell Scripts

    Create Bash shell script by opening new file in any text editor

    Advanced editors such as vim or emacs understand Bash shell syntax and provide color-coded highlighting

    Highlighting is helpful for spotting syntax errors like unpaired quotes and unclosed brackets

Command Interpreter

    First line of Bash shell script begins with 2-byte notation #!

        Commonly referred to as a "sharp-bang" or "sha-bang"

        Technically referred to as "magic pattern"

    #! indicates that file is executable shell script

    Path name follows to command interpreter that executes script

    Bash scripts are interpreted by Bash shell and so begin with:

    #!/bin/bash


Executing Bash Shell Scripts

    Use chmod and possibly chown to change script file permissions and ownership so script is executable

        Grant execute permission only to users script is intended for

    Executable script can be invoked by name on command line

    If only base name of script file is entered, Bash searches directories in shell PATH variable for first executable file matching name

        Avoid script names that match other executable files

        Configure PATH variable correctly so script is first match

    To display directory script resides in, use which

    [student@server1 ~]$ which hello
    ~/bin/hello

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo $PATH
    /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/sbin:/home/student/.local/bin:/home/student/bin


Displaying Output
Using echo

    Use echo to display arbitrary text by passing text as argument to echo

    By default, text is directed to STDOUT (standard out)

    Can be redirected to STDERR (standard error)

        Example: Use echo to display "Hello, world" to STDOUT

        [student@server1 ~]$ cat hello
        #!/bin/bash

        echo "Hello, world"

        [student@server1 ~]$ ./hello
        Hello, world

    Use echo in shell scripts to display information or error messages during script execution

        Helpful indicator of script progress

        Can be directed to STDOUT or STDERR or redirected to log file


Displaying Output

    Good practice to direct errors to STDERR to differentiate error messages from status messages

    [student@server1 ~]$ cat hello
    #!/bin/bash

    echo "Hello, world"
    echo "ERROR: Houston, we have a problem." >&2

    [student@server1 ~]$ ./hello 2> hello.log
    Hello, world

    [student@server1 ~]$ cat hello.log
    ERROR: Houston, we have a problem.

    echo is useful for script debugging

    Add echo statements to misbehaving part of script to clarify commands being executed and values of variables invoked



Quoting Special Characters

    Some characters and words have special meanings to Bash shell

    Some situations require literal values rather than the special meanings of these characters

        Example: # is interpreted by Bash as beginning of comment and is therefore ignored along with everything following on same line

        If "comment" meaning is not desired, then Bash needs to know that # is to be treated as a literal value

    To disable meaning of special characters and words, use escape character, \, single quotes, '', or double quotes, ""

    \ removes special meaning of single character immediately following

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo # not a comment

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo \# not a comment
    # not a comment

    To escape more than one character, use \ multiple times or use ''

        Single quotes preserve literal meaning of all characters they enclose

        [student@server1 ~]$ echo # not a comment #

        [student@server1 ~]$ echo \# not a comment #
        # not a comment

        [student@server1 ~]$ echo \# not a comment \#
        # not a comment #

        [student@server1 ~]$ echo '# not a comment #'
        # not a comment #


    Double quotes are like single quotes but do not preserve literal value of dollar sign ($), back-ticks (`) and backslash (\)

    The special meaning of \ is retained only when it precedes a dollar sign ($), back-tick (`), double quote ("), backslash (\), or newline

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo '$HOME'
    $HOME

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo '`pwd`'
    `pwd`

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo '"Hello, world"'
    "Hello, world"

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo "$HOME"
    /home/student

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo "`pwd`"
    /home/student

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo ""Hello, world""
    Hello, world

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo "\$HOME"
    $HOME

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo "\`pwd\`"
    `pwd`

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo "\"Hello, world\""
    "Hello, world"


Using Variables

    Useful in complex scripts

    Serve as containers in which shell script stores data

    Stored data easy to access and modify during script execution

Assigning Values to Variables

    To assign value to variable, use this syntax:

    VARIABLENAME=value

    Variable names are typically uppercase letters

        Can also be numbers, lowercase letters, and underscore character, _

        Cannot start with number

    Use = without spaces to assign values

        Example: Valid variables

        COUNT=40
        first_name=John
        file1=/tmp/abc

    Integer and string values commonly stored in variables

    Good practice to quote string values when assigning to variables

        Space character is interpreted by Bash as word separator when not enclosed in single or double quotes

    Use of single or double quotes depends on how special characters should be treated

    full_name='John Doe'
    full_name="$FIRST $LAST"
    price='(')


Expanding Variable Values

    To recall value of variable, precede variable name with $

        Process known as variable expansion

    Value of VARIABLENAME can be referenced with $VARIABLENAME

        $VARIABLENAME syntax is simplified version of ${VARIABLENAME}

    There are situations where brace-quoted form must be used

    [student@server1 ~]$ FIRST_=Jane

    [student@server1 ~]$ FIRST=John

    [student@server1 ~]$ LAST=Doe

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo $FIRST_$LAST
    JaneDoe

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo ${FIRST}_$LAST
    John_Doe


Using Bash Shell Expansion Features
Command Substitution

    Replaces invocation of command with output of its execution

        Allows output to be used in new context such as argument to another command, value of variable, and for loop construct (covered later)

    Can be invoked by enclosing command in back-ticks: `<COMMAND>`

    Preferred method is newer $() syntax: $(<COMMAND>)

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo "Current time: `date`"
    Current time is Thu Jun  5 16:24:24 EDT 2014.

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo "Current time: $(date)"
    Current time is Thu Jun  5 16:24:30 EDT 2014.


    Newer syntax preferred because it allows nesting command substitutions

    Example: Use output of find as arguments for tar and store that output in variable TAROUTPUT

    [root@server1 ~]# TAROUTPUT=$(tar cvf /tmp/incremental_backup.tar $(find /etc -type f -mtime -1))

    [root@server1 ~]# echo $TAROUTPUT
    /etc/group /etc/gshadow /etc/shadow- /etc/passwd /etc/shadow /etc/passwd- /etc/tuned/active_profile /etc/rht /etc/group- /etc/gshadow- /etc/resolv.conf




Arithmetic Expansion

    Use to perform simple integer arithmetic operations

    Syntax is $[<EXPRESSION>]

    Arithmetic expressions enclosed within $[] are replaced with results

    Before evaluation, Bash performs variable expansion and command substitution

    Nesting of arithmetic substitutions is allowed

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo $[1+1]
    2

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo $[2*2]
    4

    [student@server1 ~]$ COUNT=1; echo $[$[$COUNT+1]*2]
    4

Using Bash Shell Expansion Features

    Space characters are allowed

    Can improve readability in complicated expressions and when variables are used

    [student@server1 ~]$ SEC_PER_MIN=60

    [student@server1 ~]$ MIN_PER_HR=60

    [student@server1 ~]$ HR_PER_DAY=24

    [student@server1 ~]$ SEC_PER_DAY=$[ $SEC_PER_MIN * $MIN_PER_HR * $HR_PER_DAY ]

    [student@server1 ~]$ echo "There are $SEC_PER_DAY seconds in a day."
    There are 86400 seconds in a day.

Iterating With the for Loop

    Repetitive task can take form of action executed multiple times on single target

        Example: Checking every minute for 10 minutes to see if process has completed

    Can also take form of action executed single time on multiple targets

        Example: Backing up each database on system

    for loop is shell looping construct used for task iterations

    for <VARIABLE> in <LIST>; do
         <COMMAND>
         ...
         <COMMAND> referencing <VARIABLE>
    done

        Loop processes <LIST> items in order and exits

        Each list item stored as value of <VARIABLE> while loop executes <COMMAND>

            Naming of variable is arbitrar

<VARIABLE> value is typically referenced by <COMMAND>


    Can enter for loop items directly

    Can generate for loop items from shell expansions, such as variable substitution

        Example: Different ways that lists can be provided to for loops

    [student@server1 ~]$ for HOST in host1 host2 host3; do echo $HOST; done
    host1
    host2
    host3

    [student@server1 ~]$ for HOST in host{1,2,3}; do echo $HOST; done
    host1
    host2
    host3

    [student@server1 ~]$ for HOST in host{1..3}; do echo $HOST; done
    host1
    host2
    host3

    [student@server1 ~]$ for FILE in file*; do ls $FILE; done
    filea
    fileb
    filec

    [student@server1 ~]$ for FILE in file{a..c}; do ls $FILE; done
    filea
    fileb
    filec

    [student@server1 ~]$ for PACKAGE in $(rpm -qa | grep kernel); do echo "$PACKAGE was installed on $(date -d @$(rpm -q --qf "%{INSTALLTIME}\n" $PACKAGE))"; done
    abrt-addon-kerneloops-2.1.11-12.el7.x86_64 was installed on Tue Apr 22 00:09:07 EDT 2014
    kernel-3.10.0-121.el7.x86_64 was installed on Thu Apr 10 15:27:52 EDT 2014
    kernel-tools-3.10.0-121.el7.x86_64 was installed on Thu Apr 10 15:28:01 EDT 2014
    kernel-tools-libs-3.10.0-121.el7.x86_64 was installed on Thu Apr 10 15:26:22 EDT 2014

    [student@server1 ~]$ for EVEN in $(seq 2 2 8); do echo "$EVEN"; done; echo "Who do we appreciate?"

    2
    4
    6
    8
    Who do we appreciate?


Troubleshooting Shell Script Bugs

    Typically due to typographical errors, syntactical errors, and poor logic

    Easiest way to prevent is to catch them during authoring

    Use text editor with syntactical highlighting

    Develop good script-authoring practices and adhere to them

Commenting Scripts

    Use comments at beginning of script to explain script purpose, intended actions, and general logic

    Use comments throughout script to clarify important or complex sections

        Comments help when debugging and serve as reminders of script mechanics after time has passed

Format to Improve Readability

    As long as syntax is correct, command interpreter executes commands without regard for structure and formatting

    Break long commands into multiple lines of smaller code chunks

        Easier to read and comprehend

    Align beginning and end of multiline statements to show where control structures begin and end

        Easier to see if statement is closed properly

    Indent lines with multiline statements to represent hierarchy of code logic and flow of control structures

    Use line spacing to separate command blocks to clarify beginning and end of code sections

    Be consistent with formatting throughout script



Before

#!/bin/bash
for PACKAGE in $(rpm -qa | grep kernel); do echo "$PACKAGE was installed on $(date -d @$(rpm -q --qf "%{INSTALLTIME}\n" $PACKAGE))"; done

After

#!/bin/bash
#
# This script queries the RPM database to get information about when
# kernel-related packages were installed on a system.
#

# Variables
PACKAGETYPE=kernel
PACKAGES=$(rpm -qa | grep $PACKAGETYPE)

# Loop through packages
for PACKAGE in $PACKAGES; do
     # Determine package install date and time
     INSTALLEPOCH=$(rpm -q --qf "%{INSTALLTIME}\n" $PACKAGE)

     # RPM reports time in epoch, so need to convert
     # it to date and time format with date command
     INSTALLDATETIME=$(date -d @$INSTALLEPOCH)

     # Print message
     echo "$PACKAGE was installed on $INSTALLDATETIME"
done


Assumptions

    Do not make assumptions about integrity of inputs such as command-line arguments, user input, command substitutions, variable expansions, and file name expansions

        Use proper quoting and sanity checking

    Do not make assumptions about actions external to script such as interacting with files and calling external commands

        Use Bash file and directory tests

        Perform error checking on exit status of commands

    Ruling out assumptions can keep script from failing

    Example: Lines of code that make risky assumptions

    cd $TMPDIR
    rm *

        If directory change fails, file removal is performed on list of unknown files in unintended directory!

Modifying Someone Else’s Script

    Not everyone agrees on what good practices are

    It is important to apply guidelines consistently

    Be aware of individual differences in programming styles and script formatting

    When modifying another’s script, follow structure, formatting, and practices used by author

        Imposing your style may make script inconsistent and reduce its readability and maintainability


Debug Mode

    To activate debug mode, add -x to command interpreter in first line of script

    #!/bin/bash -x

    Another way is to execute script as argument to Bash with -x

    [student@server1 bin]$ bash -x <SCRIPTNAME>

    Debug mode prints script commands and shell expansions before executing



student@server1 bin]$ cat filesize
#!/bin/bash

DIR=/home/student/tmp

for FILE in $DIR/*; do
    echo "File $FILE is $(stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes."
done

[student@server1 bin]$ ./filesize
File /home/student/tmp/filea is 133 bytes.
File /home/student/tmp/fileb is 266 bytes.
File /home/student/tmp/filec is 399 bytes.

[student@server1 bin]$ bash -x ./filesize
+ DIR=/home/student/tmp
+ for FILE in '$DIR/*'
++ stat --printf=%s /home/student/tmp/filea
+ echo 'File /home/student/tmp/filea is 133 bytes.'
File /home/student/tmp/filea is 133 bytes.
+ for FILE in '$DIR/*'
++ stat --printf=%s /home/student/tmp/fileb
+ echo 'File /home/student/tmp/fileb is 266 bytes.'
File /home/student/tmp/fileb is 266 bytes.
+ for FILE in '$DIR/*'
++ stat --printf=%s /home/student/tmp/filec
+ echo 'File /home/student/tmp/filec is 399 bytes.'
File /home/student/tmp/filec is 399 bytes.



    Large output of debug mode may hinder troubleshooting long scripts

    Debug mode can be enabled for only part of script

    Useful when source of problem is narrowed down to portion of script

    To turned debugging on/off at specific points in script, use set -x and set +x



    This example shows previous example script with debugging enabled only for command line enclosed in for loop

    [student@server1 bin]$ cat filesize
    #!/bin/bash

    DIR=/home/student/tmp

    for FILE in $DIR/*; do
            set -x
            echo "File $FILE is $(stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes."
            set +x
    done

    [student@server1 bin]$ ./filesize
    ++ stat --printf=%s /home/student/tmp/filea
    + echo 'File /home/student/tmp/filea is 133 bytes.'
    File /home/student/tmp/filea is 133 bytes.
    + set +x
    ++ stat --printf=%s /home/student/tmp/fileb
    + echo 'File /home/student/tmp/fileb is 266 bytes.'
    File /home/student/tmp/fileb is 266 bytes.
    + set +x
    ++ stat --printf=%s /home/student/tmp/filec
    + echo 'File /home/student/tmp/filec is 399 bytes.'
    File /home/student/tmp/filec is 399 bytes.
    + set +x


    To invoke verbose mode, use -v

    Bash prints each command to STDOUT prior to execution

    To turn verbose mode on and off at specific points in script, use set -v and set +v

    [student@server1 bin]$ cat filesize
    #!/bin/bash

    DIR=/home/student/tmp

    for FILE in $DIR/*; do
        echo "File $FILE is $(stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes."
    done

    [student@server1 bin]$ bash -v ./filesize
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes."
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes.
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE
    File /home/student/tmp/filea is 133 bytes.
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes."
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes.
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE
    File /home/student/tmp/fileb is 266 bytes.
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes."
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE) bytes.
    stat --printf='%s' $FILE
    File /home/student/tmp/filec is 399 bytes.
