Introduction to systemd

    systemd System and Service Manager System: Manages startup and server processes

        Provides method for activating system resources, server daemons, other processes

    Daemons: Processes that wait or run in background performing various tasks

        Typically start automatically at boot time and continue to run until shutdown or until manually stopped

        Names generally end in d

    Socket: Used by daemon to listen for connections

        Primary communication channel with local or remote clients

        May be created by daemons or separated from daemon and created by another process

        Passed to daemon when client established connection

    Service: Often refers to one or more daemons

        Starting/stopping service may instead make one-time change to system state

        Does not involve leaving daemon process running afterward

        Called oneshot


A Bit of init History

    init process has been process ID 1 of Linux and UNIX systems for many years

        Responsible for activating other system services

        Origin of term init system

    System V and LSB init scripts started frequently used daemons on systems at boot time

        Shell scripts

        May vary from one distribution to another

    Other services such as initd or xinetd started less frequently used daemons on demand

        Listen for client connections

        Have several limitations that systemd addresses

    systemd, new init system, is process ID 1 in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

    Features include:

        Parallelization capabilities

        On-demand starting of daemons

        Automatic service dependency management

        Method of tracking related processes together

    systemd uses shell-based service scripts for few legacy services only

        Configuration files with shell variables being replaced

        Those still in use included as systemd environment files and read as NAME=VALUE pairs

        No longer sourced as shell script

systemctl and systemd Units

    To manage different types of systemd objects (units), use systemctl

    To display list of available unit types, use systemctl -t help

        systemctl may abbreviate unit names, process tree entries, and unit descriptions unless run with -l

    Common unit types:




Unit Type
Extension
Description

Service

.service
    
    Represent system services

    Use to start frequently accessed daemons, such as web server

Socket
    

.socket
    

    Represent inter-process communication (IPC) sockets

    Control of socket passed to daemon or newly started service when client connection made

    Use to delay service start at boot time and start less frequently used services on demand

    Similar to services that use xinetd superserver to start on demand

Path

.path
    

    Use to delay service activation until specific file system change occurs

    Commonly use for services which that spool directories, such as printing system

Service States

    To view service status, use systemctl status name.type

    If you do not provide unit type, systemctl shows status of service unit

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl status sshd.service

Keywords

    Output includes keywords indicating service state

    


loaded
Unit configuration file processed


active (running)
Running with one or more continuing processes

active (exited)
Successfully completed one-time configuration

active (waiting)
Running but waiting for event

inactive
Not running

enabled
Will start at boot time

disabled
Will not start at boot time

static
Cannot be enabled, but may be started by enabled unit automatically

    systemctl status NAME replaces service NAME status used in previous versions of Red Hat Enterprise Linux

Listing Unit Files With systemctl

    Query state of all units to verify system startup:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl

    Query service unit state only:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl --type=service

    Investigate any units in failed or maintenance state:

        Optionally, add -l to show full output

        [root@server1~]# systemctl status rngd.service -l

    Use alternate commands to show active and enabled states:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl is-active sshd
    [root@server1~]# systemctl is-enabled sshd

    To list active state of all loaded units:

        Optionally, limit unit type

        To add inactive units, use --all

        [root@server1~]# systemctl list-units --type=service
        [root@server1~]# systemctl list-units --type=service --all

    View enabled and disabled settings for all units:

        Optionally, limit unit type

        [root@server1~]# systemctl list-unit-files --type=service

    View only failed services:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl --failed --type=service
For more information, see:

    systemd(1), systemd.unit(5), systemd.service(5), systemd.socket(5), and systemctl(1) man pages

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux System Administrator’s Guide, Managing Services with systemd chapter, at http://docs.redhat.com/

Controlling System Services
Starting and Stopping System Daemons on a Running System

    Configuration file changes or service updates may require service restart

    Can stop service no longer used may before removing software

    Can manually start infrequently used service when needed

    View service status:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl status sshd.service

    Verify that process is running:

    [root@server1~]# ps -up PID

    Stop service and verify status:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl stop sshd.service
    [root@server1~]# systemctl status sshd.service

    Start service and view status:

        Process ID changes

        [root@server1~]# systemctl start sshd.service
        [root@server1~]# systemctl status sshd.service

    Stop and start service in single command:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl restart sshd.service
    [root@server1~]# systemctl status sshd.service

    Read and reload configuration file without complete stop and start:

        Process ID does not change

        [root@server1~]# systemctl reload sshd.service
        [root@server1~]# systemctl status sshd.service
Unit Dependencies

    Can start services as dependencies of other services

    If socket unit is enabled and service unit with same name is not, service starts automatically when request is made on network socket

    Path units can trigger services when file system condition is met

        Example: File placed into print spool directory starts cups print service:

        [root@server1~]# systemctl stop cups.service
        Warning:Stopping cups, but it can still be activated by:
          cups.path
          cups.socket

    To completely stop system printing services, stop all three units

    Disabling service disables dependencies

    To print other units that must be started if specified unit is started, use systemctl list-dependencies UNIT

        Other unit may need to be running before or after specified unit starts

    To show units that depend on specified unit to run, use --reverse

Masking Services

    System may have conflicting services installed

    Masking service prevents administrator from accidentally starting service

        Creates link in configuration directories

        If service is started, nothing happens

        [root@server1~]# systemctl mask network
        ln -s '/dev/null' '/etc/systemd/system/network.service'
        [root@server1~]# systemctl unmask network
        rm '/etc/systemd/system/network.service'

    Disabled service does not start automatically but can be started manually

    Cannot start masked service manually or automatically
Enabling System Daemons to Start or Stop at Boot

    Starting service on running system does not guarantee service will start when system reboots

    Stopping service on running system does not keep it from starting when system reboots

    To start services at boot time, create links in systemd configuration directories

        Create and remove links with systemctl commands
    View service status:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl status sshd.service

    Disable service and verify status:

        Disabling does not stop the service

        [root@server1~]# systemctl disable sshd.service
        [root@server1~]# systemctl status sshd.service

    Enable service and verify status:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl enable sshd.service
    [root@server1~]# systemctl is-enabled sshd.service

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 Boot Process

    Modern computer systems are complex combinations of hardware and software

    Moving from powered-down state to running requires large number of pieces to work together

    Following slides show tasks involved for physical x86_64 system booting Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

        List for x86_64 virtual machines roughly the same, but hypervisor in software handles some hardware-specific steps


    Machine is powered on

        System firmware (UEFI or BIOS) runs Power On Self Test (POST), starts hardware initialization

        To configure, use system BIOS/UEFI configuration screens

        Typically reach by pressing key combination during boot process

    System firmware searches for bootable device:

        UEFI: Configured in UEFI boot firmware

        BIOS: By searching for Master Boot Record (MBR) on all disks, in order configured in BIOS

        To configure, use system BIOS/UEFI configuration screens

        Typically reach by pressing key combination during boot process

    System firmware reads boot loader from disk, then passes system control to boot loader

        Typically grub2 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 system

        To configure, use grub2-install

    Boot loader loads configuration from disk and presents user with menu of possible boot configurations

        To configure, use:

            /etc/grub.d/

            /etc/default/grub

            /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (not manually)
    After user choice or automatic timeout, boot loader loads configured kernel and initramfs and places them in memory

        initramfs: gzip-ed cpio archive containing kernel modules for hardware necessary at boot, init scripts, more

        Contains entire usable system on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

        To configure, use /etc/dracut.conf

    Boot loader gives kernel system control

        Passes options specified on kernel command line in boot loader and location of initramfs

        To configure, use:

            /etc/grub.d/

            /etc/default/grub

            /boot/grub2/grub.cfg (not manually)
    Kernel initializes hardware for which it can find driver in initramfs, then executes /sbin/init from initramfs as PID 1

        On Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7, the initramfs contains:

            Working copy of systemd as /sbin/init

            udev daemon

        To configure, use init=

    systemd instance from initramfs executes units for initrd.target

        Includes mounting root file system on /sysroot.

        To configure, use /etc/fstab

    Kernel root file system switched from initramfs root file system to system root file system previously mounted on /sysroot

        systemd re-executes itself using copy of systemd installed on system

    systemd looks for default target, then starts/stops units to comply with target configuration

        Solves dependencies between units automatically

        systemd target is set of units that should be activated to reach desired system state

        Targets typically include text-based or graphical login

        To configure, use:

            /etc/systemd/system/default.target

            /etc/systemd/system/


Boot, Reboot, and Shut Down

    To power off or reboot running system from command line, use systemctl

        To stop all running services, unmount all file systems (or remount them read-only), and power down system, use systemctl poweroff

        To stop all running services, unmount all file systems, and reboot system, use systemctl reboot

    poweroff and reboot commands still exist

        In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 they are symbolic links to systemctl

    systemctl halt and halt can also stop system

        Do not power off system

        Bring system down to point where it is safe to manually power off


Selecting a systemd Target

    systemd target: Set of systemd units to start to reach desired state

    Most important targets:

raphical.target
    

System supports multiple users, graphical and text-based logins

multi-user.target
    

System supports multiple users, text-based logins only

rescue.target
    

sulogin prompt, basic system initialization completed

emergency.target
    

sulogin prompt, initramfs pivot complete, system root mounted on / read-only


Viewing Target Dependencies

    Target can be part of another target

        Example: graphical.target includes multi-user.target, which depends on basic.target and others

    To view dependencies from command line:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl list-dependencies graphical.target | grep target

    To view all available targets:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl list-units --type=target --all

    To view all targets installed on disk:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl list-unit-files --type=target --all

Selecting a Target at Runtime

    To switch to different target on running system, use systemctl isolate:

    [root@server1~]# systemctl isolate multi-user.target

    Isolating target:

        Stops all services not required by target and dependencies

        Starts any required services not yet started

    Can isolate only targets that have AllowIsolate=yes set in unit files

etting a Default Target

    After system starts and control passes initramfs to systemd, systemd tries to activate default.target

        default.target normally symbolic link to graphical.target or multi-user.target

    systemctl tool includes two commands to manage link:

        get-default

        set-default

        [root@server1~]# systemctl get-default
        multi-user.target
        [root@server1~]# systemctl set-default graphical.target
        rm '/etc/systemd/system/default.target'
        ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/graphical.target' '/etc/systemd/system/default.target'
        [root@server1~]# systemctl get-default
        graphical.target
    To select different target at boot time, append systemd.unit= to kernel command line from boot loader

        Example: To boot system into rescue shell:

        systemd.unit=rescue.target

        Do this from interactive boot loader menu before starting

    Configuration change affects single boot only

        Useful tool for troubleshooting boot process

Selecting a systemd Target

    (Re)boot system

    Interrupt boot loader menu countdown by pressing any key

    Move cursor to entry to be started

    To edit current entry, press e

    Move cursor to line starting with linux16

        This is kernel command line

    Append systemd.unit=desired.target

    Press Ctrl+x to boot with changes

For more information on the Red Hat Enterprise Linux boot process, see:

    bootup(7), dracut.bootup(7), systemd.target(5), systemd.special(7), sulogin(8), and systemctl(1) man pages

    GNU GRUB Manual, info grub2


Recovering the Root Password

    Important to be able to recover root password

    If logged in (as unprivileged user with full sudo access or as root), task is trivial

    If not logged in, task is more involved

    Number of methods to set new root password:

        Example:

            Boot system using live CD

            Mount root file system

            Edit /etc/shadow

    Method described here does not require external media

    Can have scripts run from initramfs pause, provide root shell, and continue when shell exits

    Used mostly for debugging

    Can use to recover lost root password:

        Reboot system

        Interrupt boot loader countdown by pressing any key

        Move cursor to entry needing to be booted

        To edit selected entry, press e

        Move cursor to kernel command line

            Line starts with linux16

        Append systemd.unit=rescue.target

            This breaks just before initramfs hands control to actual system

            initramfs prompt appears on console specified last on kernel command line

        To boot with changes, press Ctrl+x

console= Arguments

    Prebuilt images may place multiple console= arguments to kernel to support implementation scenarios

    Caveat with systemd.unit=rescue.target:

        Many kernel messages will be sent to all consoles

        Prompt ultimately uses whichever console is last

    If you do not get prompt, may want to temporarily reorder console= arguments


Recovering Password Without SELinux Context

    root shell is presented with root file system for actual system mounted read-only on /sysroot

    SELinux not enabled at this point

    Any new files created do not have SELinux context assigned

    Tools such as passwd first create file, then move it in place of file they intend to edit

        Effectively creates new file without SELinux context

    Remount /sysroot as read-write:

    switch_root:# mount -oremount,rw /sysroot

    Switch into chroot jail, where /sysroot is treated as root of file system tree:

    switch_root:# chroot /sysroot

    Set new root password:

    sh-4.2# passwd root

    Make sure all unlabeled files get relabeled during boot:

    sh-4.2# touch /.autorelabel

    Type exit twice:

        First exits chroot jail

        Second exits initramfs debug shell

            System continues booting, performs full SELinux relabel, and reboots

    Can be useful to look at previous (failed) boot logs

    If journald log is persistent, can use journalctl to look at logs

    To make sure persistent journald logging is enabled:

    [root@server1~]# mkdir -p -m2775 /var/log/journal
    [root@server1~]# chown :ystemd-journal /var/log/journal
    [root@server1~]# killall -USR1 systemd-journald

    To inspect log files for previous boot, use -b option to journalctl

        Without arguments, -b filters output to messages pertaining to this boot

        With negative number as argument, `b filters on previous boots

        [root@server1~]# journalctl -b-1 -p err

        Shows all messages rated as error or worse from previous boot


Diagnose and Repair systemd Boot Issues
Early Debug Shell

    Running systemctl enable debug-shell.service spawns root shell on TTY9 early during boot sequence

        Shell automatically logged in as root

        Can use other debugging tools while system is still booting

    Remember to disable debug-shell.service service when done debugging

        Leaves unauthenticated root shell open to anyone with local console access

Emergency and Rescue Targets

    Appending systemd.unit=rescue.target or systemd.unit=emergency.target to kernel command line from boot loader spawns system into special rescue or emergency shell

        Shells require root password

        emergency target keeps root file system mounted read-only

        rescue.target waits for sysinit.target to complete first so more of system will be initialized

    Can use shells to fix issues that prevent system from booting normally

        Examples: Dependency loop between services, incorrect entry in /etc/fstab

    Exiting from shells continues regular boot process


Stuck Jobs

    During startup, systemd spawns number of jobs

    If some cannot complete, they block other jobs from running

    To inspect current job list, use systemctl list-jobs

    Any running jobs must complete before waiting jobs can continue

    

For more information on repairing common boot issues, see:

    dracut.cmdline(7), systemd-journald(8), journalctl(1), sushell(8), and systemctl(1) man pages

    /usr/lib/systemd/system/debug-shell.service

    /etc/fstab errors and corrupt file systems can stop system from booting

    systemd generally continues to boot after timeout or drops to emergency repair shell that requires root password

    Common errors and results:

Corrupt file system
    

systemd attempts fsck. If problem is too serious for automatic fix, user is prompted to run fsck manually from emergency shell.

Non-existent device/UUID referenced in /etc/fstab
    

systemd waits for set amount of time, waiting for device to become available. If device does not become available, user is dropped to emergency shell after timeout.

Non-existent mount point in /etc/fstab
    

systemd creates mount point if possible; otherwise, drops to emergency shell.

Incorrect mount option specified in /etc/fstab
    

User dropped to emergency shell.


Repairing File System Issues at Boot

    To diagnose and fix issue, can also use emergency.target

        No file systems are mounted before emergency shell is displayed

    When using automatic recovery shell during file system issues, remember to issue systemctl daemon-reload after editing /etc/fstab

        Without reload, systemd continues using old version

For more information on repairing file system issues at boot, see the following man pages: systemd-fsck(8), systemd-fstab-generator(3), and systemd.mount(5).


Repairing Boot Loader Issues

    grub2: Boot loader used by default on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

        Second major version of GRand Unified Bootloader

        Can use to boot on BIOS and UEFI systems

        Supports booting almost any operating system that runs on modern hardware

    /boot/grub2/grub.cfg: Main configuration file for grub2

        Do not edit this file directly

        Use grub2-mkconfig to generate configuration using set of different configuration files, and list of installed kernels.

    grub2-mkconfig looks at /etc/default/grub for options such as default menu timeout and kernel command line

    Then uses set of scripts in /etc/grub.d/ to generate configuration file

Making Permanent Changes

    To make permanent changes to boot loader configuration:

        Edit configuration files listed previously

        Then run:

        [root@server1~]# grub2-mkconfig > /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

    For major changes, can run command without redirection to inspect results first

Important Directives

    To troubleshoot broken grub2 configuration, need to understand /boot/grub2/grub.cfg syntax

        Bootable entries encoded inside menuentry blocks

        In blocks, linux16 and initrd16 lines point to:

            Kernel to load from disk

            Kernel command line

            initramfs to load

        During interactive editing at boot, can use Tab completion to find files

        set root lines do not point to root file system for Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

            Instead point to file system from which grub2 should load kernel and initramfs files

        Syntax is harddrive,partition, where:

            hd0 is first hard drive in system, hd1 second, etc.

            Partitions indicated as msdos1 for first MBR partition or gpt1 for first GPT partition

Reinstalling the Boot Loader

    If boot loader becomes corrupted, use grub2-install to reinstall

        BIOS: Provide disk where grub2 should be installed in MBR as argument

        UEFI: No argument necessary if EFI system partition mounted on /boot/efi

    

For more information on repairing boot loader issues, see the following sections in the GNU GRUB Manual:

    info grub2

    info grub2-install

    Chapter 28: "Invoking grub2-install"
