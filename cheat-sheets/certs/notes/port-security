    SELinux Port Labeling

Rich Rules
Direct Rules

    Allow inserting hand-coded {ip,ip6,eb}tables rules into zones managed by firewalld

    Powerful, expose netfilter kernel features, but can be hard to manage

    Not as flexible as standard rules and rich rules

    Unless explicitly inserted into zone managed by firewalld, direct rules are parsed before firewalld rules

        Example: Add direct rules to blacklist an IP range

        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --direct --permanent --add-chain ipv4 raw blacklist
        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --direct --permanent --add-rule ipv4 raw PREROUTING 0 -s 192.168.0.0/24 -j blacklist
        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --direct --permanent --add-rule ipv4 raw blacklist 0 -m limit --limit 1/min -j LOG --log-prefix "blacklisted "
        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --direct --permanent --add-rule ipv4 raw blacklist 1 -j DROP

    

For more info, see the firewall-cmd(1) and firewalld.direct(5) man pages.

Rich Rules

    Way to express custom firewall rules not covered by basic firewalld syntax

        Example: Allow connections to service only from single IP address instead of all IP addresses routed through zone

    Use rich rules to configure:

        Basic allow/deny rules

        Logging to syslog and auditd

        Port forwards, masquerading, and rate limiting

    Basic rich rule syntax:

    rule
      [source]
      [destination]
      service|port|protocol|icmp-block|masquerade|forward-port
      [log]
      [audit]
      [accept|reject|drop]

    Most rule elements can take additional arguments in form option=value

    For more info on rich rules syntax, see the firewalld.richlanguage(5) man page.

Rule Ordering

    Rule order impacts how firewall behaves

    Basic order inside zone is same for all zones:

        Port forwarding and masquerading rules

        Logging rules

        Deny rules

        Allow rules

    In all cases, first match wins

    Packet not matched by rule is typically denied

        Zones might have different default

        Example: trusted zone accepts unmatched packets

    After matching logging rule, packet is processed as normal

Direct Rule Parsing

    Direct rules are exception to "first match wins"

    Most direct rules are parsed before other processing by firewalld

    Direct rule syntax allows inserting any rule anywhere in any zone

Testing and Debugging

    Can add most rules to runtime configuration with timeout

    When rule with timeout is added, timer starts countdown for rule

    When timer reaches zero seconds, rule is removed from runtime configuration

    Timeouts are useful on remote firewalls when testing complicated rule sets

    If rule works, can add rule again

        Add with --permanent or no timeout

    If rule does not work, rule is removed automatically

    To add timeout to runtime rule, add --timeout=<TIMEINSECONDS> to end of firewall-cmd that enables rule

Working With Rich Rules

    Can use firewall-cmd options with --permanent and --zone=<ZONE>


--add-rich-rule='<RULE>'
    

Adds <RULE> to specified zone, or default zone if no zone specified.

--remove-rich-rule='<RULE>'
    

Removes <RULE> to specified zone, or default zone if no zone specified.

--query-rich-rule='<RULE>'
    

Queries if <RULE> was added to specified zone, or default zone if no zone specified. Returns 0 if rule is present; 1 otherwise.

--list-rich-rules
    

Outputs all rich rules for specified zone, or default zone if no zone specified.

Rich Rules Examples

    Reject all traffic from IP address 192.168.0.11 in classroom zone

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=classroom --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=192.168.0.11/32 reject'

        When using source or destination with address option, set family= option of rule to either ipv4 or ipv6

    Allow 2 new connections to ftp per minute in default zone

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule service name=ftp limit value=2/m accept'

        Change made in runtime configuration only

    Drop all incoming IPsec esp protocol packets from anywhere in default zone

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-rich-rule='rule protocol value=esp drop'

    Accept all TCP packets on ports 7900, up to and including port 7905, in vnc zone for 192.168.1.0/24 subnet

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=vnc --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=192.168.1.0/24 port port=7900-7905 protocol=tcp accept'

Logging With Rich Rules

    When debugging or monitoring firewall, use log of accepted and rejected connections

    firewalld can log to syslog or send messages to kernel audit subsystem, managed by auditd

    In both cases, logs can be rate limited

        Ensures log files do not fill too fast or use too much disk space

    Basic rich rule syntax for logging to syslog:

    log [prefix="<PREFIX TEXT>" [level=<LOGLEVEL>] [limit value="<RATE/DURATION>"]

        <LOGLEVEL> is emerg, alert, crit, error, warning, notice, info, or debug

        <DURATION> can be s for seconds, m for minutes, h for hours, or d for days

    Example: Limit log messages to maximum of 3 per minute:

    limit value=3/m

    Basic syntax for logging to audit subsystem:

    audit [limit value="<RATE/DURATION>"]

    Rate limiting is configured same as syslog logging

        Example: Accept new connections to ssh from work zone, log new connections to syslog at notice level, with maximum of 3 message per minute

        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=work --add-rich-rule='rule service name="ssh" log prefix="ssh " level="notice" limit value="3/m" accept

        Example: Reject new IPv6 connections to DNS from subnet 2001:db8::/64 in default zone for next 5 minutes, log rejected connections to audit system with maximum of 1 message per hour

        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv6 source address="2001:db8::/64" service name="dns" audit limit value="1/h" reject' --timeout=300

For more info, see these man pages: firewalld.richlanguage(5), firewall-cmd(1), and firewalld.direct(5).

Masquerading and Port Forwarding
Network Address Translation

    firewalld supports two types of Network Address Translation (NAT):

        Masquerading

        Port forwarding

    Use regular firewall-cmd rules for basic configuration

    Use rich rules for advanced forwarding configuration

    Both forms of NAT modify packet before sending it on

        Example: Change source or destination

Masquerading

    System forwards packets not addressed to itself to recipient **Changes source address of packets to its own public IP address

    When answers to packets come in, firewall modifies destination address to address of original host and sends the packet on

    Used on edge of network to provide Internet access to internal network

    Masquerading is form of NAT

    Masquerading can be used only with IPv4, not IPv6.


Masquerading and Port Forwarding

How Masquerading Works

    Machine behind firewall sends packet to address outside of local network.

    Because destination address is not on local subnet, packet is routed to default gateway on source machine.

    Firewall accepts packet, changes source address to external IP for firewall, stores reference to connection in connection state table, and then passes packet to router on Internet, based on routing table.

How Masquerading Works

    Machine behind firewall sends packet to address outside of local network.

    Because destination address is not on local subnet, packet is routed to default gateway on source machine.

    Firewall accepts packet, changes source address to external IP for firewall, stores reference to connection in connection state table, and then passes packet to router on Internet, based on routing table.

    Answer to packet comes back from Internet. Router looks up connection in connection state table, then changes destination address to original sender, and passes packet on.

    Original sender receives answer to request.

Configuring Masquerading

    To configure zone masquerading, use this firewall-cmd syntax:

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=<ZONE> --add-masquerade

        Masquerades packets not addressed to firewall itself

            Packets sent to firewall from clients defined in sources for zone (both interfaces and subnets)

    To gain more control over which clients are masqueraded, use rich rule:

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=<ZONE> --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=192.168.0.0/24 masquerade'

Port Forwarding

    Forwards traffic to single port

        Either different port on same machine or port on different machine

    Used to hide server behind another machine

    Used to provide access to service on alternate port

    When configured to forward packets to a different machine, replies from other machine are sent directly to original client

        Results in invalid connection on most configurations

        Machine that is forwarded to must be masqueraded through firewall that performed port forwarding

        Common configuration is to forward port from firewall machine to machine already masqueraded behind firewall


Port Forwarding Example

    Assumptions:

        Machine with IP address 10.0.0.100 behind firewall is running web server on port 8080/TCP

        Firewall is configured to forward traffic coming in on port 80/TCP on its external interface to port 8080/TCP on that machine

    Process:

        Client from Internet sends packet to port 80/TCP on external interface of firewall.

        Firewall changes destination address and port of packet to 10.0.0.100 and 8080/TCP and forwards it.

            Source address and port remain unchanged.

        Machine behind firewall sends response to this packet.

            Because machine is masqueraded (and firewall is configured as default gateway), packet is sent to original client

            Appears to come from external interface on firewall


Configuring Port Forwarding

    To configure port forwarding with regular firewall-cmd commands:

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=<ZONE> --add-forward-port=port=<PORTNUMBER>:proto=<PROTOCOL>[:toport=<PORTNUMBER>][:toaddr=<IPADDR>]

        Both toport= and toaddr= are optional, but at least one must be specified

        Example: To forward incoming connections on port 513/TCP on firewall to port 132/TCP on machine with IP address 192.168.0.254 for clients from public zone:

        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=public --add-forward-port=port=513:proto=tcp:toport=132:toaddr=192.168.0.254

    To gain more control over port forwarding rules, use rich rules:

    forward-port port=<PORTNUM> protocol=tcp|udp [to-port=<PORTNUM>] [to-addr=<ADDRESS>]

        Example: To forward traffic from 192.168.0.0/26 in work zone to port 80/TCP to port 8080/TCP on firewall:

        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=work --add-rich-rule='rule family=ipv4 source address=192.168.0.0/26 forward-port port=80 protocol=tcp to-port=8080'

    For more info, see the firewalld.richlanguage(5) and firewall-cmd(1) man pages.

SELinux Port Labeling
SELinux Port Labeling

    SELinux does more than file and process labeling

    SELinux policy enforces network traffic

    SELinux labels network ports to control network traffic

        Example: In targeted policy, port 22/TCP has label ssh_port_t

    Whenever process wants to listen on port:

        SELinux checks if label associated with process (domain) is allowed to bind port label

        Can stop rogue service from taking over ports used by legitimate network services

SELinux Port Labeling
Managing SELinux Port Labeling

    When admin rusn service on non-standard port, SELinux port labels typically need to be updated

    targeted policy may have already labeled port with type that can be used

        Example: Port 8008/TCP is often used for web applications

            Port is already labeled http_port_t

            Default web server port type

Listing Port Labels

    To view current port label assignments, use semanage with port subcommand

    To list all current assignments, use -l

        Use form port_label_t tcp|udp comma,separated,list,of,ports

        [root@server1 ~]# semanage port -l
        ...
        http_cache_port_t       tcp   8080, 8118, 8123, 10001-10010
        http_cache_port_t       udp   3130
        http_port_t             tcp   80, 81, 443, 488, 8008, 8009, 8443, 9000
        ...

    To view only local changes to policy, add -C

    Port label can appear twice in output, once for TCP and once for UDP

    Can also use system-config-selinux graphical tool

        Part of policycoreutils-gui package

Managing Port Labels

    To assign new port labels, remove port labels, or modify existing ones, use semanage

    Only local modifications can be removed or modified

        To allow service to bind to port label normally associated with another service, you must write a small policy module

        Cannot remove port label from policy without overriding policy module that provided that label

    To add port to existing port label (type):

    [root@server1 ~]# semanage port -a -t port_label -p tcp|udp PORTNUMBER

        Example: To allow gopher service to listen on port 71/TCP:

        [root@server1 ~]# semanage port -a -t gopher_port_t -p tcp 71

targeted Policy

    targeted policy ships with many port types

    selinux-policy-devel package contains per-service documentation on SELinux types, Booleans, and port types in service-specific SELinux man pages

    To install these man pages, if needed:

    [root@server1 ~]# yum -y install selinux-policy-devel
    [root@server1 ~]# mandb
    [root@server1 ~]# man -k _selinux

Removing Port Labels

    Syntax to remove custom port label is same as to add

        Use -a instead of -d

        Example: To remove binding of port 71/TCP to gopher_port_t:

        [root@server1 ~]# semanage port -d -t gopher_port_t -p tcp 71

Modifying Port Bindings

    Can modify port label if wrong type or requirements change

    More efficient than removing old binding and adding new one

    To make modifications, use -m

        Example: To modify port 71/TCP from gopher_port_t to http_port_t:

        [root@server1 ~]# semanage port -m -t http_port_t -p tcp 71

For more info, see these man pages: semanage(8), semanage-port(8), *_selinux(8), and system-config-selinux(8).
