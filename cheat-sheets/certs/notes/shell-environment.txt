Environment Variables

    Environment variables are variables that are passed to subprocesses

    Applications and sessions use them to determine their behavior

        Common environment variables: PATH, USER, and HOSTNAME

    To make variable into environment variable, flag it with export

        Will be passed, with value, to any subprocess spawned from shell

    Any variable defined in shell can be environment variable

    To view all environment variables, use env

    Example: Set MYVAR and spawn sub-shell

        MYVAR variable does not exist in sub-shell

        [student@DEM ~]$ MYVAR="some value"
        [student@DEM ~]$ echo $MYVAR
        some value
        [student@DEM ~]$ bash
        [student@DEM ~]$ echo $MYVAR
        [student@DEM ~]$ exit

    Example: Set MYVAR, tag MYVAR with export, and spawn sub-shell

        MYVAR environment variable exists in sub-shell

        [student@DEM ~]$ MYVAR="some value"
        [student@DEM ~]$ export MYVAR
        [student@DEM ~]$ echo $MYVAR
        some value
        [student@DEM ~]$ bash
        [student@DEM ~]$ echo $MYVAR
        some value
        [student@DEM ~]$ exit


bash Startup Scripts

    Upon login, environment variables initialize bash environment

    Several shell scripts execute:

        Start with /etc/profile

        Follow with profile in user’s home directory, typically ~/.bash_profile

    Bash shell looks for one of three files in user’s home directory:

        .bash_profile

        .bash_login

        .profile

    Shell looks for files in this order and executes first file it locates

    Profiles contain additional scripting that calls other shell scripts

    Bash login scripting typically looks like this:

/etc/profile
           \__ /etc/profile.d/*.sh

~/.bash_profile
              \__ ~/.bashrc
                         \__ /etc/bashrc

Profiles:

    Set and export environment variables

    Run commands that run only upon login

    Only executed in login shell

RCs:

    Run commands, set aliases, define functions, and other settings that cannot be exported to sub-shells

    Execute every time shell is created (login or non-login)

        File call can override default settings provided by system-wide scripts

        Many Red Hat config files contain comment about where to add user-specific changes

alias

    To define own system command or override system command, use alias

        Aliases are parsed and substituted before shell checks PATH

    Can use alias to display aliases defined in shell

    [student@DEM ~]$ alias
    alias egrep='egrep --color=auto'
    alias fgrep='fgrep --color=auto'
    alias grep='grep --color=auto'
    alias l.='ls -d .* --color=auto'
    alias ll='ls -l --color=auto'
    alias ls='ls --color=auto'
    alias vi='vim'
    alias which='alias | /usr/bin/which --tty-only --read-alias --show-dot --show-tilde'


    Use alias to set an alias that exists only for the duration of current shell

    alias mycomm="<command to execute>"

    [student@DEM ~]$ alias usercmd='echo "Hurrah!"; ls -l'
    [student@DEM ~]$ usercmd
    Hurrah!
    total 0
    -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student 0 Jun  9 13:21 file1
    -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student 0 Jun  9 13:21 file2
    -rw-rw-r--. 1 student student 0 Jun  9 13:21 file3


    To make alias persistent, add alias to bottom of ~/.bashrc

    [student@DEM ~]$ vi ~/.bashrc
    ...
    # User specific aliases and functions
    alias usercmd='echo "Hurrah!"; ls -l'

    Alias added to ~/.bashrc will be available in every shell created

    To remove alias from environment, use unalias

Functions

    Function isolates code segment so it can be called repeatedly

    Updated code executes everywhere function is referenced

        Example: pathmunge function defined in shell script in /etc/profile

         pathmunge () {
          if [ "[" = "after" ] ; then
            PATH=$PATH:(
          else
            PATH=(:$PATH
          fi
        }
        ...
        if [ "$EUID" = "0" ]; then
            pathmunge /sbin
            pathmunge /usr/sbin
            pathmunge /usr/local/sbin
        else
            pathmunge /usr/local/sbin after
            pathmunge /usr/sbin after
            pathmunge /sbin after
        fi


    Can also set functions in Bash shell environment

    When set in environment, can execute as commands, similar to aliases

    Unlike aliases, functions can:

        Take arguments

        Perform more sophisticated actions

        Provide return code

    Can type functions into current shell

        Preferable to set in user’s ~/.bashrc or global /etc/bashrc

    To see default functions and variables in current shell environment, use set

    To remove function from environment, use unset and function or variable name

    For more info, see these man pages: bash(1), env(1), and builtins(1).
