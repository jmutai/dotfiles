What Is NFS?

    Network File System (NFS): Network file system commonly used by UNIX systems and network-attached storage devices

        Lets multiple clients share access to files over network

        Provides access to shared directories/files from client systems

    NFS protocol transmits data in clear text over network.

    Server relies on client to identify users

    Do not export directories with sensitive information without Kerberos authentication and encryption


NFS Exports

    NFS server installation requires nfs-utils package

        Provides necessary utilities to export directory with NFS to clients

    /etc/exports: Configuration file for NFS server exports

        Lists directory to share to client hosts over network

        Indicates hosts/networks that can access export

    Instead of adding information required for exporting directories to /etc/exports

        Can add *.exports file to /etc/exports.d/ directory holding configuration of exports

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 does not support exporting same directory with NFS and Samba

        NFS and Samba use different file locking mechanisms

        Can cause file corruption


Listing Clients as DNS-Resolvable Host Name

    DNS-resolvable host name

        Example: /myshare exported and can be mounted by server0.example.com:

        /myshare server0.example.com

    DNS-resolvable host name with wildcards

        Use * for multiple characters

        Use ? for single character

        Example: Allow all subdomains in example.com to access NFS export:

        /myshare *.example.com

    DNS-resolvable host name with character class lists in square brackets

        Example: server0.example.com through server20.example.com have access to NFS export:

        /myshare server[0-20].example.com



Listing Clients as IPv4 Address or Network

    IPv4 address

        Example: Allow access to /myshare from 192.168.0.1:

        /myshare 192.168.0.1

    IPv4 network

        Example: Use /etc/exports to access to /myshare from 192.168.0.0/16:

        /myshare 192.168.0.0/16



Listing Clients as IPv6 Address or Network

    IPv6 address without square brackets

        Example: Allow client with IPv6 address 2000:472:18:b51:c32:a21 access to /myshare:

        /myshare 2000:472:18:b51:c32:a21

    IPv6 network without square brackets

        Example: All IPv6 network 2000:472:18:b51::/64 access to NFS export:

        /myshare 2000:472:18:b51::/64

    To export directory to multiple hosts simultaneously:

        Specify multiple targets with options

        Separate by spaces following directory to export

        /myshare *.example.com 192.168.0.0/16


NFS Exports
Specifying Export Options

    Specify export options in round brackets as comma-separated list followed by client definition


ro
    
Read-only

    Default setting

    Can explicitly specify it with entry

    Restricts NFS clients to read-only on NFS share

    

    State ro for server0.example.com:

    /myshare desktop0.example.com(ro)


rw
    
Read-Write

    Allows read and write access for NFS clients

    

    desktop0.example.com can access NFS export read-only

    server[0-20].example.com has read-write access to NFS share

    /myshare desktop0.example.com(ro) server[0-20].example.com(rw)


no_root_squash
    
Disable root Squash

    Default: NFS server treats root on NFS client as user nfsnobody

    If root attempts to access file on mounted export, server treats it as access by user nfsnobody

    Can be problematic if diskless client uses NFS export as / and root needs to be treated as root

    To disable, server needs to add no_root_squash to export options in /etc/exports

    

    Allow diskless.example.com read-write and real root user access to /myshare:

    /myshare diskless.example.com(rw,no_root_squash)

    Configuration is not secure

    Better done in conjunction with Kerberos authentication and integrity checking



Configuration Steps 1-5

    Start NFS service on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl start nfs-server

    Enable NFS service to start at boot on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl enable nfs-server

    Create /myshare to share with NFS on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# mkdir /myshare

    Export /myshare directory on server1 to desktop1 client as read- and write-enabled share:

        Add following line to /etc/exports on server1

        /myshare desktop1.example.com(rw)

    Save file and then apply changes:

    [root@server1 ~]# exportfs -r


Configuration Steps 6-9

    Configure firewalld to enable access to NFS exports immediately:

        NFS port 2049/TCP for nfsd must be open on server

        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs

    Reload firewalld rules to apply new rules:

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload

    Use /mnt/nfsexport on desktop1 to mount NFS-exported directory:

    [root@desktop1 ~]# mkdir /mnt/nfsexport

    On desktop1, mount share on /mnt/nfsexport:

    [root@desktop1 ~]# mount server1.example.com:/myshare /mnt/nfsexport

    For more info on exporting the NFS file system, see these man pages: nfs(5), mount(8), mount.nfs(8), exportfs(8), and exports(5).


Kerberos-Enabled NFS Exports

    NFS server does not require authentication

        By default, enforces access restriction based on IP address or client host name only

    NFS server provides options to secure access to files using:

        none

        sys

        krb5

        krb5i

        krb5p

    NFS server can choose to offer single or multiple methods for each exported share

    NFS clients must connect to exported share using method mandated for that share
            Specified as mount option sec=method


none
    

    Anonymous access to files

    Writes to server allocated UID/GID nfsnobody

    Requires SELinux Boolean nfsd_anon_write to be active

sys
    

    File access based on standard Linux file permissions for UID and GID values

    If not specified, is default

    NFS server trusts any UID sent by client

krb5
    

    Clients must prove identity using Kerberos

    Then standard Linux file permissions apply

    UID/GID determined based on Kerberos principal from accessing user

`krb5i
    

    Adds cryptographically strong guarantee that data in each request not tampered with

    UID/GID determined based on Kerberos principal from accessing user

krb5p
    

    Adds encryption to all requests between client and server

    Prevents data exposure on network

    Has performance impact but provides most security

    UID/GID determined based on Kerberos principal from accessing user


Security Option Requirements

    To use security options that use Kerberos server:

        nfs-secure-server needs to be running

        nfs-server service must be running on system exporting NFS shares

    Client requires nfs-secure to run to help with Kerberos authentication

    Kerberos options require /etc/krb5.keytab and additional authentication configuration

        /etc/krb5.keytab normally provided by authentication/security administrator

    Request keytab that includes:

        Host principal

        nfs principal

        Both


Configuration Steps 1-4

    Install keytab provided at http://​classroom.example.com/pub/keytabs/server1.example.com.keytab on server1 system:

    [root@server1 ~]# wget -O /etc/krb5.keytab http://classroom.example.com/pub/keytabs/server1.example.com.keytab

    Start nfs-secure-server on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl start nfs-secure-server

    Enable nfs-secure-server to start at system boot on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl enable nfs-secure-server

    Create /securedexport directory on server1:

        Used as NFS export

        [root@server1 ~]# mkdir /securedexport


Configuration Steps 5-8

    Add /securedexport to /etc/exports to export with NFS:

        Enable krb5p security to secure access to NFS share

        Allow read and write access to exported directory from all subdomains of example.com

        [root@server1 ~]# echo '/securedexport *.example.com(sec=krb5p,rw)' >>/etc/exports

    After /etc/exports saved, apply changes:

    [root@server1 ~]# exportfs -r

    Configure firewalld to enable access to NFS exports immediately:

        NFS port 2049/TCP for nfsd must be open on server

        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs

    Reload firewalld rules so new rule gets applied:

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload


Configuration Steps 9-10

    Install provided keytab on desktop1:

        desktop1 acts as NFS client

        Mount krb5p-secured share on desktop1

        [root@desktop1 ~]# wget -O /etc/krb5.keytab http://classroom.example.com/pub/keytabs/desktop1.example.com.keytab

    start and enable nfs-secure to ensure always available on desktop1

        NFS uses nfs-secure on client side to help manage communication with server when connecting to Kerberos-secured shares

        nfs-secure must be running to use secured NFS shares

        [root@desktop1 ~]# systemctl enable nfs-secure
        ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-secure.service'  ...
        [root@desktop1 ~]# systemctl start nfs-secure

            

        nfs-secure is part of nfs-utils package. It should be installed by default. If not, run:

        [root@desktop1 ~]# yum -y install nfs-utils


Configuration Steps 11-13

    Create /mnt/securedexport on desktop1:

        Mount point must exist to mount krb5p-secured export from server1 on desktop1

        [root@desktop1 ~]# mkdir /mnt/securedexport

    Mount exported directory on desktop1 with krb5p security enabled:

    [root@desktop1 ~]# mount -o sec=krb5p server1.example.com:/securedexport /mnt/securedexport

    Unmount /mnt/securedexport on desktop1:

    [root@desktop1 ~]# umount /mnt/securedexport


SELinux and Labeled NFS

    SELinux locks down capabilities of services in Red Hat Enterprise Linux

    NFS mounts have SELinux context nfs_t by default

        Independent of SELinux context they have on server that provides export

    To change behavior on client side, use context="selinux_context"

        Example: Mount NFS export and enforce SELinux context system_u:object_r:public_content_rw_t:s0:

        [root@server1 ~]# mount -o context="system_u:object_r:public_content_rw_t:s0" server1.example.com:/myshare 


SELinux and Labeled NFS
NFS 4.2

    To force NFS server to properly export SELinux context of share, switch to NFS version 4.2

        Currently exists as Internet draft

        Already implemented in NFS server shipped by Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

        Need to turn on explicitly

    To enable NFS 4.2 on server1 to export SELinux labels:

        Change RPCNFSDARGS="" line in /etc/sysconfig/nfs to:

        RPCNFSDARGS="-V 4.2"

        Restart nfs-server or nfs-secure-server:

        [root@server1 ~]# systemctl restart nfs-server
        [root@server1 ~]# systemctl restart nfs-secure-server



SELinux and Labeled NFS

    On client side, specify mount -o v4.2 as mount option:

    [root@desktop1 ~]# mount -o sec=krb5p,v4.2 server1.example.com:/securedexport /mnt/securedexport

    For testing purposes, selinux.txt file created in /securedexport directory

        After creation, SELinux type changed to public_content_t:

        [root@server1 ~]# touch /securedexport/selinux.txt
        [root@server1 ~]# chcon -t public_content_t /securedexport/selinux.txt

    All SELinux labels now properly handled by server1 and forwarded to desktop1:

    [root@desktop1 ~]# ls -Z /mnt/securedexport/
    -rw-r--r--. root root unconfined_u:object_r:public_content_t:s0 selinux.txt


SELinux Booleans

    nfs_export_all_ro and nfs_export_all_rw SELinux Booleans enabled in default Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 installation

        Allows NFS daemon to read and write almost any file

    To lock down NFS server capabilities, disable Booleans

        To make content readable by NFS, use public_content_t or nfs_t context

        To make content readable and writable, use public_content_rw_t or nfs_t context

            If using public_content_rw_t, enable nfsd_anon_write Boolean to allow writes

    

    For more on NFS-related SELinux, see the nfsd_selinux(8) man page

        Provided by selinux-policy-devel RPM package

    For more on protecting NFS exports, see these man pages: nfs(5), mount(8), mount.nfs(8), exportfs(8), exports(5), and nfsd_selinux(8).]


What Is SMB?

    Server Message Block (SMB): Standard file-sharing protocol for Microsoft Windows servers/clients

    Can configure SMB file servers multiple ways

        Simple method: Configure file servers and clients as members of common Windows workgroup

        Workgroup announces servers and clients to local subnet

    File servers manage local user accounts/passwords independently

    More sophisticated configurations may be members of Windows domain

        Coordinate user authentication through domain controller

    Using Samba, Red Hat Enterprise Linux can act as server for SMB file shares

    Kernel driver and utilities in cifs-utils handle mounting SMB file shares as client


SMB File Sharing With Samba

    Samba can share Linux file systems as SMB network file shares

    Steps to configure Samba to provide SMB file share as workgroup member:

        Install samba package

        Prepare permissions on directory to be shared

        Configure /etc/samba/smb.conf

        Set up Linux users with NTLMv2 passwords

        Start Samba and open local firewall

        Verify share can be mounted from client

    To deploy Samba on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, install samba

        Can install directly or via file-server package group:

        [root@server1 ~]# yum install samba

Preparing Directories for Sharing

    Do not use Samba to share directory that is also NFS export or mounted NFS file system

        Can result in file corruption, stale file locks, file access issues with share

    Create directory to be shared if it does not exist:

    [root@server1 ~]# mkdir /sharedpath

Users and Regular Permissions

    Permissions to set on directory depend on:

        Who needs access

        How clients will mount it

    Client normally mounts share by authenticating access to SMB server as particular user

    All files on share need to be readable (possibly writable) by user used to mount share


SELinux Contexts and Booleans

    For Samba to work correctly with SELinux in enforcing mode:

        Directory needs correct SELinux contexts

        May need to set certain SELinux Booleans

    If shared directory only accessed through Samba:

        Label directory, subdirectories, and files samba_share_t

        Gives Samba read and write access

    Recommended: Configure SELinux so restorecon sets samba_share_t on share and contents if file system is relabeled

    [root@server1 ~]# semanage fcontext -a -t samba_share_t '/sharedpath(/.*)?'
    [root@server1 ~]# restorecon -vvFR /sharedpath
    restorecon reset /sharedpath context unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0->system_u:object_r:samba_share_t:s0

    Samba can also serve files labeled with SELinux types:

        public_content_t: Read-only

        public_content_rw_t: Read-write

            To allow read-write access to files/directories labeled public_content_rw_t, must enable smbd_anon_write


/etc/samba/smb.conf

    /etc/samba/smb.conf: Main configuration file for Samba

        Divided into multiple sections

        Each starts with section name in square brackets

        Followed by list of parameters set to particular values

    /etc/samba/smb.conf starts with [global] section

        Used for general server configuration

    Subsequent sections define file or printer share provided by Samba server

    [homes] and [printers] sections have special uses

    Line beginning with either ; or # character commented out

[global] Section: workgroup and security

    Defines basic configuration of Samba server

    Configures three things:

        workgroup: Specifies Windows workgroup for server

            Most systems default to WORKGROUP

            Windows XP Home defaulted to MSHOME

            Helps systems browse for server using NetBIOS for TCP/IP name service

            To set workgroup to WORKGROUP, change workgroup entry in /etc/samba/smb.conf to workgroup = WORKGROUP

        security: Controls how Samba authenticates clients

            For security = user, clients log in with username/password managed by local Samba server

            This is default in /etc/samba/smb.conf



[global] Section: hosts allow

    hosts allow: comma-, space-, tab-delimited list of hosts permitted to access Samba service

        If not specified, all hosts can access Samba

        If not specified in [global] section, can set on each share separately

        If specified in [global] section, applies to all shares

    Can specify hosts by host name or source IP address

        Host names checked by reverse-resolving IP address of incoming connection attempt

        For full syntax, see hosts_access(5) man page

    Can specify allowed hosts as:

        IPv4 network/prefix: 192.168.0.0/24

        IPv4 network/netmask: 192.168.0.0/255.255.255.0

        If IPv4 subnet prefix is on byte boundary: 192.168.0.

        IPv6 network/prefix: [2001:db8:0:1::/64]

        Host name: desktop.example.com

        All hosts ending in example.com: .example.com

    Example: To restrict access to only hosts from 192.168.0.0/16 network using trailing dot notation, use hosts allow = 192.168

    Example: To additionally allow access from all host names ending with ".example.com", use hosts allow = 192.168. .example.com


File Share Sections

    To create file share, at end of /etc/samba/smb.conf:

        Place share name in brackets to start new section for share

    Key directives to set:

        path: Must set to indicate directory to share—for example, path = /sharedpath

        writable = yes: Set to give authenticated users read-write access to share

            Default setting: writable = no

            If writable = no, can provide comma-separated write list of users with read-write access to share

            Users not on list have read-only access

            Can specify access for local group members: write list = @management

        valid users: Specifies list of users allowed to access share

            Users not on list not allowed to access share

            If list is blank, all users can access share

    Example: Allow user fred and members of group management read-only access to myshare:

    [myshare]
        path = /sharedpath
        writable = no
        valid users = fred, @management


[homes] Section

    Defines special file share

    Enabled by default

    Makes local home directories available via SMB

    Can specify share name as homes

        Samba server convert it to home directory path of authenticating user or as specific username

    samba_enable_home_dirs allows local Linux home directories to be shared by Samba to other systems

        Must enable this for [homes] to work: setsebool -P samba_enable_home_dirs=on

    use_samba_home_dirs allows remote SMB file shares to be mounted and used as local Linux home directories

        Easy to confuse two options


Validating /etc/samba/smb.conf

    To verify no errors in edited smb.conf file, use testparm with no arguments

    read only = no is same as writable = yes

        Can be confusing

        [root@server1 ~]# testparm
        Load smb config files from /etc/samba/smb.conf
        rlimit_max: increasing rlimit_max (1024) to minimum Windows limit (16384)
        Processing section "[random]"
        Processing section "[homes]"
        Processing section "[printers]"
        Loaded services file OK.
        Server role: ROLE_STANDALONE
        Press enter to see a dump of your service definitions

        [global]
            server string = Samba Server Version %v
            log file = /var/log/samba/log.%m
            max log size = 50
            idmap config * : backend = tdb
            cups options = raw

        [random]
            comment = Test File Share
            path = /srv/random

        [homes]
            comment = Home Directories
            read only = No
            browseable = No

[printers]
    comment = All Printers
    path = /var/spool/samba
    printable = Yes
    print ok = Yes
    browseable = No


Preparing Samba Users

    security = user requires Linux account with Samba account that has NTLM password.

    To create a Samba-only system:

        Keep Linux password locked

        Set the login shell to /sbin/nologin

    Prevents login of user directly, or with ssh on system

        Example: Create locked Linux account for user fred:

        [root@server1 ~]# useradd -s /sbin/nologin fred


    samba-client contains smbpasswd command

        Use to create Samba accounts and set passwords:

        [root@server1 ~]# yum -y install samba-client

    If smbpasswd passed username without options, attempts to change account password

        root user can use -a to add Samba account and set NTLM password

        root user can use -x to delete Samba account and password for user

        Example: CreateSamba account for fred and assign NTLM password:

        [root@server1 ~]# smbpasswd -a fred
        New SMB password:  redhat
        Retype new SMB password:  redhat
        ...
        Added user fred.

    pdbedit: More powerful tool for root user

        pdbedit -L lists all users with Samba accounts configured on system

        For more information, see the pdbedit(8) man page


Starting Samba

    To start Samba services immediately and enable them to start at boot time, use systemctl:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl start smb nmb
    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl enable smb nmb

    Starts two services: smbd and nmbd

        Must communicate through local firewall

    smbd normally uses TCP/445 for SMB connections

        Listens on TCP/139 for NetBIOS over TCP backward compatibility

    nmbd daemon uses UDP/137 and UDP/138 to provide NetBIOS over TCP/IP network browsing support


    To configure firewalld to let clients talk to local Samba services:

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=samba
    success
    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
    success

    Samba checks to determine if /etc/samba/smb.conf has been changed

        If yes, Samba automatically reloads file

        Does not affect any connections already established to Samba service, until connection closed or Samba is restarted

    To reload the configuration file immediately, use systemctl reload smb nmb

    To restart Samba entirely, use systemctl restart smb nmb

Regular SMB Mounts

    To mount SMB file shares on local system, use cifs-utils package

        Can mount from Samba server or Microsoft Windows server

    Default: SMB mounts use single set of user credentials (mount credentials) to:

        Mount share

        Determine access rights to files on share

    All users on Linux system using mount use same credentials to determine file access


    To mount share, use mount

    Default: NTLMv2 password hashing encapsulated in Raw NTLMSSP messages (sec=ntlmssp) used to authenticate users

        Expected by recent versions of Microsoft Windows

    Two ways to provide mount credentials:

        If mounting interactively at shell prompt, use username= to specify SMB user to authenticate as

            User prompted for password

        If mounting automatically, use credentials= to provide credentials file readable only by root containing username/password


Example

    To mount the myshare:

        From SMB file server server1

        Authenticating as SMB user fred

        Who has NTLM password redhat:

        [root@desktop1 ~]# mkdir /mnt/myshare
        [root@desktop1 ~]# mount -o username=fred //server1.example.com/myshare /mnt/myshare
        Password for fred@//server1/myshare:  redhat


For more info on providing SMB file shares, see these man pages: samba(7), smb.conf(5), testparm(1), mount(8), mount.cifs(8), smbpasswd(8), pdbedit(8), and samba_selinux(8).


Multiuser Mounts With Samba

    When Samba share mounted, mount credentials determine access permissions on mount point

    multiuser separates mount credentials from credentials used to determine file access for users

        Can use with sec=ntlmssp authentication

        mount.cifs(8) man page incorrect

    Root user mounts share using multiuser and SMB username with minimal access to share contents

    Users can stash SMB usernames and passwords in session kernel keyring usig cifscreds

    Share access authenticated with user credentials from keyring

        Not mount credentials

    Users can clear or change credentials for login session any time
    Credentials cleared when session ends

File access permissions enforced by SMB server based on access credentials in use


Example

    Create mount point /mnt/multiuser

        Mount myshare from SMB file server server1

        Authenticate as SMB user fred

            Has NTLM password redhat

        Use multiuser mount option:

        [root@desktop1 ~]# mkdir /mnt/multiuser
        [root@desktop1 ~]# mount -o multiuser,sec=ntlmssp,username=fred \
        > //server1/myshare /mnt/multiuser
        Password for fred@//server1/myshare:  redhat

cifscreds

    To store authentication credentials in keyring of local user, use cifscreds

        Credentials forwarded to Samba server on multiuser mount

        cifs-utils package provides cifscreds

            Required on desktop1

            [root@desktop1 ~]# yum -y install cifs-utils



add
    

    Adds SMB credentials to user session keyring of a user

    Followed by SMB file server host name

update
    

    Updates existing credentials in user session keyring

    Followed by SMB file server host name

clear
    

    Removes entry from user session keyring

    Followed by Samba server host name

clearall
    

* Clears all existing credentials from user session keyring



cifscreds and Usernames

    cifscreds assumes username to use with SMB credentials matches Linux username

    To use different username for SMB credentials, add -u username after add, update, or clear

        Example: Root mounts //server1/myshare on /mnt/multiuser using multiuser

            To access files on share, frank must use cifscreds to stash username/password in kernel-managed session keyring:

            [frank@desktop1 ~]$ cifscreds add server1
            Password:  redhat
            [frank@desktop1 ~]$ echo "Frank was here" >/mnt/multiuser/frank2.txt
            [frank@desktop1 ~]$ cat /mnt/multiuser/frank2.txt
            Frank was here.
            [frank@desktop1 ~]$ exit

            Assume permissions on SMB share files grant frank read-write access to directory, but grant jane read access only:

            [jane@desktop1 ~]$ cifscreds add server1
            Password:  redhat
            [jane@desktop1 ~]$ echo "Jane was not here" >/mnt/multiuser/jane2.txt
            -bash: /mnt/multiuser/jane2.txt: Permission denied
            [jane@desktop1 ~]$ cat /mnt/multiuser/frank2.txt
            Frank was here

    To learn more about performing a multiuser SMB mount, see these man pages: mount(8), mount.cifs(8), and cifscreds(1).
