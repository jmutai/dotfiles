Apache HTTPD
Introduction to Apache HTTPD

    Apache HTTPD is one of most-used web servers on Internet

    Web server is daemon that speaks http(s)

        Text-based protocol for sending and receiving objects over network connection

    http is sent over wire in clear text, using port 80/TCP by default

        443/TCP also by default

    Basic HTTP exchange has client connecting to server and using GET to request resource

        Other commands, like HEAD and POST, allow clients to:

            Request just resource metadata

            Send server more information


Apache HTTPD
Example HTTP Request

GET /hello.html HTTP/1.1
Host: webapp0.example.com
User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:24.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/24.0
Accept: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8
Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5
Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate
Connection: keep-alive
Cache-Control: max-age=0

Example HTTP Reply

    Content-Type header is mandatory, telling client type of content being sent

    Length of content must match length in Content-Length header

    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Date: Tue, 27 May 2014 09:57:40 GMT
    Server: Apache/2.4.6 (Red Hat) OpenSSL/1.0.1e-fips mod_wsgi/3.4 Python/2.7.5
    Content-Length: 12
    Keep-Alive: timeout=5, max=82
    Connection: Keep-Alive
    Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

    Hello World!


    HTTP protocol seems easy, but difficult to implement with:

        Security

        Support for clients that do not adhere to standard

        Support for dynamically generated pages

    Most application developers do not write web servers

    Instead, write applications to run behind web server like Apache HTTPD


    Fully configurable and extendable web server with full HTTP support

    Can extend with modules

    Provided in httpd package

    web-server package group also installs httpd-manual package

        After httpd.service service starts, can access full Apache HTTPD manual at http://localhost/manual


    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 ships with web-server-environment environment group

    web-server-environment pulls in web-server group by default

        Includes optional groups for backup tools and database clients

    Dependency of httpd is httpd-tools package

    httpd-tools includes tools to:

        Manipulate password maps and databases

        Resolve IP addresses in logfiles to hostnames

        Benchmark and stress-test web servers (ab)


Configuring Apache HTTPD

    After installation, default configuration written to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

    Serves contents of /var/www/html for requests coming in to any hostname over plain HTTP

    Basic syntax of httpd.conf is

        Key Value configuration directives

        HTML-like <Blockname parameter> blocks with embedded directives

    Key/value pairs outside block affect entire server configuration

    Key/value pairs inside block affect configuration indicated by block, or when requirement set by block is met

Starting Apache HTTPD

    Start httpd from the httpd.service systemd unit

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl enable httpd.service
    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl start httpd.service

    To request status information, use systemctl status -l httpd.service

        If httpd fails to start, output typically indicates why

Network Security

    firewalld has two predefined services for httpd:

        http opens port 80/TCP

        https opens port 443/TCP

        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=http --add-service=https
        [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload

    In default configuration, SELinux allows httpd to bind to specific ports

    To see list of ports, use semanage port -l | grep '^http_'

    For overview of allowed port contexts and their usage, see httpd_selinux (8) man page from selinux-policy-devel package

Using Alternate Document Root

    Content does not need to be served out of /var/www/html

    When changing DocumentRoot setting, make these changes also:

        File system permissions: Any new DocumentRoot must be readable by apache user or apache group

            In most cases, DocumentRoot should never be writable by apache user or group

        SELinux: Default SELinux policy restricts what contexts can be read by httpd

            Default context for web server content is httpd_sys_content_t

            Rules are in place to relabel /srv/*/www/ with this context

    To serve content from outside standard locations, use semanage to add new context rule

    [root@server1 ~]# semanage fcontext -a -t httpd_sys_content_t '/new/location(/.*)?'

    For more info on allowed file contexts and their intended usage, see the httpd_selinux(8) man page from the selinux-policy-devel package.

Allowing Write Access to DocumentRoot

    In default configuration, only root has write access to DocumentRoot

    To provide write access to DocumentRoot:

        Set (default) ACL on DocumentRoot

            Example: Give write access to webmasters group, and use /var/www/html as DocumentRoot

            [root@server1 ~]# setfacl -R -m g:webmasters:rwX /var/www/html
            [root@server1 ~]# setfacl -R -m d:g:webmasters:rwx /var/www/html

            Uppercase X bit sets executable bit only on directories

                Not directories and files

            Especially relevant when done in conjunction with recursive action on directory tree


    Create new DocumentRoot owned by webmasters group (sticky bit set)

    [root@server1 ~]# mkdir -p -m 2775 /new/docroot
    [root@server1 ~]# chgrp webmasters /new/docroot

    Combine first two approaches with other permissions closed off, and ACL added for apache group

Virtual Hosts
Introduction

    Virtual hosts allow single httpd server to serve content for multiple domains

    httpd can use different settings, including DocumentRoot, based on:

        IP address of server connected to

        Hostname requested by client in HTTP request

        Combination of both

    Typically used when not cost-effective to spin up multiple VMs for many low-traffic sites

        Example: Shared hosting environment


Configuring Virtual Hosts

    To configure virtual hosts, use <VirtualHost> blocks inside main configuration

    To ease administration, virtual host blocks are not defined in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf

        Defined instead in separate .conf files in /etc/httpd/conf.d/

    Example /etc/httpd/conf.d/site1.conf file

    <Directory /srv/site1/www> 
        Require all granted
        AllowOverride None
    </Directory>

    <VirtualHost 192.168.0.1:80> 
        DocumentRoot /srv/site1/www 
        ServerName site1.example.com 
        ServerAdmin webmaster@site1.example.com 
        ErrorLog "logs/site1_error_log" 
        CustomLog "logs/site1_access_log" combined 
    </VirtualHost>



Name-Based vs. IP-Based Virtual Hosting

    Every virtual host is IP-based: sorts traffic to virtual hosts based on IP address client connected to

    If multiple virtual hosts are declared for single IP/port combination, ServerName and ServerAlias directives are consulted

        This effectively enables name-based virtual hosting

Wildcards and Priority

    IP address part of <VirtualHost> directive can be replaced with wildcards _default_ and *

        Both mean "match anything"

    When HTTP request comes in:

        httpd first tries to match against virtual hosts with explicit IP address

        If no match, checks virtual hosts with wildcard IP address

        If no match, main server configuration is used


<VirtualHost *:80>

    <VirtualHost *:80> always matches regular HTTP traffic on port 80/TCP

        Effectively disables main server configuration for traffic on port 80/TCP

    If no match found for ServerName or ServerAlias, and multiple virtual hosts are defined for IP/port combination request came in on, first virtual host that matches IP/port is used

        "First" determined by order in which hosts are defined in configuration file

        Multiple *.conf files are included in alphanumeric order

            To create catch-all (default) virtual host, name configuration file something like 00-default.conf


Troubleshooting Virtual Hosts

    Configure separate DocumentRoot for each virtual host, with identifying content

    Configure separate log files for error logging and access logging

    Evaluate order in which virtual host definitions are parsed by httpd

        Files are read in alphanumeric order based on filename

    Disable virtual hosts one by one to isolate a problem

        Comment out virtual host definitions in configuration file(s)

        Temporarily rename include files to not end in .conf

    Use journalctl UNIT=httpd.service to isolate log messages from just httpd.service

HTTPS
Transport Layer Security (TLS)

    TLS used to encrypt network communications

        Successor to Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)

    Allows client to verify identity of server, and server to verify client

    Based on certificates

    Certificate has multiple parts:

        Public key

        Server identity

        Signature from certificate authority

    Corresponding private key is never made public

        Any data encrypted with private key can be decrypted only with public key, and vice versa


TLS Handshake

    During initial handshake:

        Set up encrypted connection

        Client and server agree on set of encryption ciphers supported by both

        Client and server exchange bits of random data

    Client uses random data to generate session key

        Key used for faster symmetric encryption—same key used for both encryption and decryption

    To secure key, it is sent to server encrypted with server’s public key (part of server certificate)

Configuring TLS certificates

    Obtain signed certificate

    Install Apache HTTPD extension modules to support TLS

    Configure virtual TLS host

Obtaining a Certificate

    Two options:

        Create self-signed certificate (signed by itself, not Certificate Authority)

        Create certificate request

            Have reputable CA sign request so it becomes a certificate

    crypto-utils package contains genkey utility that supports both methods



    To create certificate (signing request) with genkey:

    [root@server1 ~]# genkey <FQDN>

        <FQDN> is fully qualified domain name clients use to connect to server

    genkey asks following:

        Desired key size: Choose at least 2048 bits

        Should signing request be made: Answering no creates self-signed certificate

        Should private key be protected with passphrase

        Identity of server


    After certificate process completes, several files are created:

        /etc/pki/tls/private/<fqdn>.key: Private key

            Keep at 0600 or 0400 permissions

            SELinux context of cert_t

            Do not share

        /etc/pki/tls/certs/<fqdn>.0.csr: Generated if signing request created

            Send to CA to be signed

            Never need to send private key to CA

        /etc/pki/tls/certs/<fqdn>.crt: Public certificate

            Returned from the CA when self-signed certificate requested

            Keep permissions at 0644 with SELinux context of cert_t


Installing Apache HTTPD Modules

    Apache HTTPD needs extension module to activate TLS support

        Install using mod_ssl package

    mod_ssl enables httpd for default virtual host listening on port 443/TCP

        Host configured in /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Configuring Virtual Host with TLS

    Configure TLS virtual hosts same as regular virtual hosts with additional parameters

    Can use name-based virtual hosting with TLS, but some older browsers are not compatible



Simplified /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Listen 443 https 
SSLPassPhraseDialog exec:/usr/libexec/httpd-ssl-pass-dialog 
SSLSessionCache         shmcb:/run/httpd/sslcache(512000)
SSLSessionCacheTimeout  300
SSLRandomSeed startup file:/dev/urandom  256
SSLRandomSeed connect builtin
SSLCryptoDevice builtin
<VirtualHost _default_:443> 
    ErrorLog logs/ssl_error_log
    TransferLog logs/ssl_access_log
    LogLevel warn
    SSLEngine on 
    SSLProtocol all -SSLv2 
    SSLCipherSuite HIGH:MEDIUM:!aNULL:!MD5 
    SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt 
    SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
    CustomLog logs/ssl_request_log \
            "%t %h %{SSL_PROTOCOL}x %{SSL_CIPHER}x \"%r\" %b"
</VirtualHost>


    If signed certificate used, and certificate does not have embedded copies of all certificates used in signing up to root CA, server must provide certificate chain

        Copy of all CA certificates used in signing process concatenated together

        To identify file, use SSLCertificateChainFile directive

    When defining new TLS-encrypted virtual host, do not need to copy entire contents of ssl.conf

        Need <VirtualHost> block with SSLEngine On directive

        Need configuration for certificates

    Example of name-based TLS virtual host

    <VirtualHost *:443>
      ServerName demo.example.com
      SSLEngine on
      SSLCertificateFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/demo.example.com.crt
      SSLCertificateKeyFile /etc/pki/tls/private/demo.example.com.key
      SSLCertificateChainFile /etc/pki/tls/certs/example-ca.crt
    </VirtualHost>

    Example is missing important directives such as DocumentRoot

        Are inherited from main configuration

    Not defining protocols and ciphers to use results in httpd using default options. httpd defaults are not considered secure. It is highly recommended to restrict both to a more secure subset.


Configuring Forward Secrecy

    If server private key is compromised (server break-in, crypto code bug), attacker could decrypt recorded session

    Protecting against these types of attacks is called ensuring forward secrecy

    To establish forward secrecy:

        Carefully tune allowed ciphers in SSLCipherSuite directive

        Have server always select most preferred cipher that both server and client support

    Example: Best set of ciphers to allow

    SSLCipherSuite "EECDH+ECDSA+AESGCM EECDH+aRSA+AESGCM EECDH+ECDSA+SHA384 EECDH+ECDSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+SHA384 EECDH+aRSA+SHA256 EECDH+aRSA+RC4 EECDH EDH+aRSA RC4 !aNULL !eNULL !LOW !3DES !MD5 !EXP !PSK !SRP !DSS"
    SSLHonorCipherOrder On

        List prioritizes ciphers that perform initial session key exchange using elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman (EECDH) algorithms

        Session key is never transmitted; it is calculated by both sides

        SSLHonorCipherOrder On directive (last line) instructs httpd to prefer ciphers listed earlier in SSLCipherSuite list, regardless of client preference

    Security research is always-ongoing

        Re-evaluate selected ciphers on regular basis


Configuring HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS)

    Common misconfiguration, which results in warnings in most browsers, is having web page served out over HTTPS include resources served out over clear-text HTTP

    To protect against this, add line inside <VirtualHost> block that has TLS enabled

    Header always set Strict-Transport-Security "max-age=15768000"

        Sending extra header informs clients they are not allowed to fetch resources for this page that are not served using TLS

    Another issue is clients connecting over HTTP to resource they should have used HTTPS for

    Not serving content over HTTP solves issue

        More subtle approach is to redirect clients connecting over HTTP to the same resource using HTTPS


    To set up redirect, configure http virtual host for same ServerName and ServerAlias as TLS-protected virtual host

        Catch-all virtual host can be used

    Add following lines inside <VirtualHost *:80> block:

    RewriteEngine on
    RewriteRule ^(/.*)$ https://%{HTTP_POST}( [redirect=301]

        RewriteEngine on directive turns on URL rewrite module for virtual host

        RewriteRule matches any resource (^(/.*)$) and redirects it using HTTP Moved Permanently message ([redirect=301]) to same resource served out over HTTPS

        %{HTTP_HOST} variable uses hostname requested by client, while ( part is back-reference to whatever was matched between first set of parentheses in regular expression

Dynamic Web Content
Common Gateway Interface (CGI)

    CGI is one of oldest forms of generating dynamic content

    When CGI resource is requested, httpd executes resource as process and serves the stdout of that process

    CGI resources mostly written in scripting languages like Perl

        C programs and Java executables also common

    Environment variables used to make request information (including client info) available to CGI program


Configuring httpd for CGI

    To have httpd treat location as CGI executables, use following syntax in httpd configuration

    ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ "/var/www/cgi-bin/"

    Instructs httpd to redirect requests for files under /cgi-bin/ URI to /var/www/cgi-bin/ directory and treat files in that directory as executable scripts

    CGI scripts:

        Are executed as apache user and group

        Should be executable by apache user and group

        Should have httpd_sys_script_exec_t SELinux context

    CGI directory:

        Should have Options None

        Should have access granted using normal <Directory> block

Serving Dynamic PHP Content

    PHP scripting language is popular way to provide dynamic content

    Performance and security improved by having httpd run PHP interpreter internally

    php package adds special mod_php module httpd

    Default configuration for mod_php adds lines to httpd

    <FilesMatch \.php$>
      SetHandler application/x-httpd-php
    <FilesMatch>
    DirectoryIndex index.php

        <FilesMatch> block instructs httpd to use mod_php for file names ending in .php

        DirectoryIndex directive adds index.php to list of files searched when directory is requested


Serving Dynamic Python Content

    Python scripts also popular for dynamic content

    python and httpd support newer Web Server Gateway Interface (WSGI) protocol

    mod_wsgi package adds WSGI support to httpd

    Unlike mod_php or CGI, WSGI does not start new script/interpreter for every request

        Main application is started, and all requests are routed to that application

    To configure httpd to support WSGI application:

        Install mod_wsgi package

        Add WSGIScriptAlias line to virtual host definition

    Example: Send all requests for http://servername/myapp and any resources below it to WSGI application /srv/myapp/www/myapp.py

    WSGIScriptAlias /myapp/ /srv/myapp/www/myapp.py

    WSGI applications should:

        Be executable by apache user and group

        Have SELinux contexts set to httpd_sys_content_t



Database Connectivity

    Most web applications store and retrieve persistent data

        Common approach is database such as MariaDB or PostgreSQL

    When database runs on same host as web server and uses standard network port, SELinux allows network connection from web application

    When database runs on remote host, set SELinux Boolean httpd_can_network_connect_db to 1 to allow connection

    When network connection needed from within web application, and target is not well-known database port, set SELinux Boolean httpd_can_network_connect to 1 to allow connection

    Other SELinux Booleans also affect how web applications are executed by httpd
