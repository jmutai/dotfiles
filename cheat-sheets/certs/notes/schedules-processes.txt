    Managing Temporary Files With systemd-tmpfiles

System cron Jobs

    Not defined using crontab

    Configured in a set of configuration files

    Configuration files have extra field between Day-of-Week and Command fields

        Specifies user under which to run job

etc/crontab has useful syntax diagram in comments:

 # For details see man 4 crontabs

# Example of job definition:
# .---------------- minute (0 - 59)
# |  .------------- hour (0 - 23)
# |  |  .---------- day of month (1 - 31)
# |  |  |  .------- month (1 - 12) OR jan,feb,mar,apr ...
# |  |  |  |  .---- day of week (0 - 6) (Sunday=0 or 7) OR sun,mon,tue,wed,thu,fri,sat
# |  |  |  |  |
# *  *  *  *  * user-name  command to be executed

    System cron jobs defined in:

        /etc/crontab

        /etc/cron.d/*

    Packages that install cron jobs should place file in /etc/cron.d/

        Admins can use this location to:

            Group related jobs in single file

            Push jobs using configuration management system

Predefined Jobs

    Run every hour, day, week, and month

    Execute all scripts placed in /etc/cron.hourly/, /etc/cron.daily/, /etc/cron.weekly/, and /etc/cron.monthly/

        Directories must contain scripts not cron configuration files

    Hourly scripts execute using run-parts from job defined in /etc/cron.d/0hourly

    Daily, weekly, and monthly jobs execute using run-parts from /etc/anacrontab configuration file

        File parsed by regular crond daemon

        Ensures important jobs always run

Syntax of /etc/anacrontab

    Different from other cron configuration files

    Contains four fields per line:

Delay in minutes
    

Amount of time cron daemon should wait before starting job

Job identifier
    

    Name of file in /var/spool/anacron/ that checks if job has run

    Updates timestamp on file when cron starts job from /etc/anacrontab

    Uses timestamp to check when job was last run

Command  Command to execute

Managing Temporary Files With systemd-tmpfiles

    Modern systems require temporary files and directories, such as:

        Highly user-visible /tmp

        Task-specific daemons

        User-specific volatile directories /run

            Volatile directory exists only in memory

            Content disappears after system reboots or loses power

    Temporary directories and files must be created when they do not exist

        Daemons and scripts rely on their presence

    Old files must also be purged

        Take up space

        Might provide faulty information

    Historically:

        RPM packages and SystemV init-scripts created directories

        tmpwatch removed old, unused files

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7:

        systemd-tmpfiles provides structured and configurable method to manage temporary directories and files

        When systemd starts system, systemd-tmpfiles-setup is one of first services launched

            Runs systemd-tmpfiles --create --remove

            Reads configuration files from /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf, /run/tmpfiles.d/*.conf, and /etc/tmpfiles.d/*.conf

            Removes files and directories marked for deletion in those configuration files

            Creates files and directories marked for creation

            Fixes permissions as specified

Regular Cleaning

    Use systemd timer unit to clean stale data in long-running systems

        Calls systemd-tmpfiles --clean at regular interval

        Special systemd service with [Timer] block

            Indicates how often specified service should start

            [Timer]
            OnBootSec=15min
            OnUnitActiveSec=1d

    systemd-tmpfiles --clean parses same configuration files as systemd-tmpfiles --create

        Purges files and directories versus creates

        Linux files follow POSIX standard with three timestamps:

            atime: Last time file accessed

            mtime: Last time file modified

            ctime: Last time file status changed

        Files are considered unused if all three timestamps are older than systemd-tmpfiles maximum age

    To see all three timestamps for a file, use stat

    To display mtime, use ls -l

systemd-tmpfiles configuration files

    Configuration file format detailed in tmpfiles.d man page

    Basic syntax consists of seven columns: Type, Path, Mode, UID, GID, Age, and Argument.

        Type refers to action systemd-tmpfiles should take

            Use d to create a directory if it does not yet exist

            Use Z to recursively restore SELinux contexts and file permissions and ownership

    A few examples:

    d /run/systemd/seats 0755 root root -

    D /home/student 0700 student student 1d

    L /run/fstablink - root root - /etc/fstab


Configuration File Precedence

    Configuration files can live in three places:

/etc/tmpfiles.d/*.conf
    

    Files meant for administrators to configure custom temporary locations

    Can override vendor-provided defaults

/run/tmpfiles.d/*.conf
    

    Files are volatile

    Normally used by daemons to manage their own runtime temporary files

/usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/*.conf
    

    Files provided by relevant RPM packages

    Administrators should not edit these files

    If file in /run/tmpfiles.d/ has same name as file in /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/, then file in /run/tmpfiles.d/ is used

    If file in etc/tmpfiles.d/ has same name as file in /run/tmpfiles.d/ or /usr/lib/tmpfiles.d/, then file in /etc/tmpfiles.d/ is used

    To override vendor-provided settings, copy relevant file to /etc/tmpfiles.d/ and edit it

    To apply commands from only one configuration file, specify name of configuration file on command line
