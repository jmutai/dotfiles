Network File System

    NFS: Internet standard protocol used by Linux, UNIX, and similar operating systems as native network file system

        Open standard under active extension

        Supports native Linux permissions and file system features

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 supports NFSv4 by default

        If v4 not available, falls back automatically to NFSv3 and NFSv2.

    NFSv4 uses TCP to communicate with server

        Older versions of NFS use either TCP or UDP


NFS Mounting Methods

    NFS servers export shares (directories)

    NFS clients mount exported share to local mount point (directory)

        Local mount point must exist

    NFS shares can be mounted in these ways:

        Mount NFS share manually using mount

        Mount NFS share automatically at boot using /etc/fstab

        Mount NFS share on demand using automounting

NFS Security Methods

    NFS server can offer single or multiple methods for each exported share

    NFS clients must connect using methods mandated for that share

        To specify mount option, use sec=method

sys
    

File access based on standard Linux file permissions for UID and GID values. If not specified, this is the default.

krb5
    

Clients must prove identity using Kerberos and then standard Linux file permissions apply.

krb5i
    

Adds a cryptographically strong guarantee that the data in each request has not been tampered with.

krb5p
    

Adds encryption to all requests between the client and the server, preventing data exposure on the network. This will have a performance impact.
    Kerberos options require, as a minimum, a /etc/krb5.keytab (provided by the authentication or security administrator) and additional authentication configuration (not covered here). Request a keytab that includes either a host principal, nfs principal, or (ideally) both.


nfs-secure

    Negotiates and manages communication with server when connecting to Kerberos-secured shares

    Must be running to use secured NFS shares

        Start and enable to ensure it is always available:

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo systemctl enable nfs-secure
        ln -s '/usr/lib/systemd/system/nfs-secure.service'  ...
        [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo systemctl start nfs-secure

    nfs-secure is part of nfs-utils package

        Usually installed by default

        To install manually, use:

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo yum -y install nfs-utils

Mount an NFS Share

    Identify: Do one of the following:

        Obtain export details and security requirements from NFS server admin

        Identify NFSv4 shares by mounting root folder of NFS server and exploring exported directories as root

            Denies access to shares using Kerberos security

            Share (directory) name is visible

            Other share directories are browsable

            [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo mkdir /mountpoint
            [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo mount server1:/ /mountpoint
            [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo ls /mountpoint

        Discover NFSv2 and NFSv3 shares using showmount

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ showmount -e server1

    Mount point: Use mkdir to create mount point in suitable location:

[student@desktop1 ~]$ mkdir -p /mountpoint


    Mount: Switch to root or use sudo and do one of the following:

        Manual: Use mount

            To specify file system type for NFS shares, use -t nfs (not strictly required)

            To synchronize write operations with NFS server, use -o sync (default is asynchronous)

            [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo mount -t nfs -o sync server1:/share /mountpoint

        /etc/fstab: Use vim to add mount entry to bottom of /etc/fstab

            NFS share is mounted at each system boot

            [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo vim /etc/fstab
            ...
            server1:/share  /mountpoint  nfs  sync  0 0

        To manually unmount the share, use umount with root privileges

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo umount /mountpoint

For more info, see these man pages: mount(8), umount(8), fstab(5), and mount.nfs(8).

Automounter

    autofs service managed like other system services

    Can automatically mount NFS shares on demand

    Automatically unmounts NFS shares when no longer used

    Do not need root privileges to run mount or umount

        NFS shares available to all users with access permissions

    Frees network and system resources

        Unlike entries in /etc/fstab, NFS shares are not permanently connected

    No server-side configuration

    Uses same mount options as mount

    Flexible mount point locations

        Direct and indirect mount point mapping
    
    No need to manually manage indirect mount points

        Created and removed by autofs

Can automount range of file systems (default=NFS)


Create an Automount

    Install autofs:

    [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo yum -y install autofs

    Add master-map file to /etc/auto.master.d:

        Identifies base directory for mount points

        Identifies mapping file for creating automounts

            Use vim to create and edit master-map file:

            [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo vim /etc/auto.master.d/demo.autofs

                Must have .autofs extension

                Can hold multiple mapping entries

                Or, use multiple files to separate configuration data

            Add master-map entry to same or separate file:

                For indirectly mapped mount points, add /shares /etc/auto.demo

                    All indirect map entries use /shares as base directory

                    /etc/auto.demo contains mount details

                    Create auto.demo before starting autofs

                For directly mapped mount points, add /- /etc/auto.direct

                    All direct map entries use /- as base directory

                    /etc/auto.direct contains mount details

    Create the mapping file(s) to identify mount point, mount options, and source location:

        Use vim to create and edit mapping file:

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo vim /etc/auto.demo

            Located in /etc and called auto.name (replace name with something meaningful)

        Add map entry:

        work  -rw,sync  server1:/shares/work

            Entry format: mount point, mount options, source location

                Mount point or key: Created and removed automatically by autofs

                    No need to align local mount point names and server directory structure

                Mount options: Start with - (dash) and are comma-separated with no white space

                    Options available are same as manual mount

                    Useful automount-specific options:

                        Use fstype to specify the file system if it is not NFS

                        Use strict to treat errors, when mounting file systems, as fatal

                Source location: NFS shares follow host:/pathname pattern

                    If file system to be mounted begins with / (slash), such as local device entries or SMB shares, then prefix with : (colon)

                        Example: SMB share would be ://server1/share.
Use systemctl to start and enable autofs:

[student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo systemctl enable autofs


Direct Maps

    Map NFS share to existing mount point

    Automounter will not attempt to create mount point automatically

        Example: content for /etc/auto.direct might look like:

        /mnt/docs  -rw,sync  server1:/shares/docs

    Mount point (or key) is always an absolute path

        Starts with / (slash)

        Rest of mapping file uses same structure

    Only right-most directory under automounter control

        Directory structure above mount point is not obscured by autofs

Indirect Wildcard Maps

    Automounter can be configured to access any subdirectory exported by NFS server using single mapping entry

        Example, if server1:/shares exports two or more subdirectories that are accessible with same mount options, then content for /etc/auto.demo might look like:

        *  -rw,sync  server1:/shares/&

        Mount point (or key) is * (asterisk)

        Subdirectory on source location is & (ampersand)

        Everything else in entry is same as direct entry

For more info, see these man pages: autofs(5), automount(8), auto.master(5), and mount.nfs(8).

Connect to SMB Shares

    Red Hat Enterprise Linux uses Samba server to provide services Microsoft Windows clients can use

    Samba implements SMB protocol

        CIFS is dialect of SMB

    Red Hat desktops and servers can connect to shares offered via any server that uses SMB protocol

        Identify remote share to access

        Determine mount point where share should be mounted and create mount point’s empty directory

        Mount network file system with appropriate command or configuration change

    Before mounting SMB shares:

        Install cifs-utils (required)
        Install samba-client (optional)

Mount an SMB Share

    Identify: Do one of the following:

        Obtain share details from SMB server host admin

        Use client that can browse shares, such as smbclient

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ smbclient -L //server1

            Use -L to list available shares

    Mount point: Use mkdir to create mount point in suitable location:

    [student@desktop1 ~]$ mkdir -p /mountpoint

Mount an SMB Share

    Mount: Switch to root or use sudo and do one of the following:

        Manual: Use mount

            To specify SMB as file system type, use -t cifs

            To try and authenticate as guest account without password, use -o guest

            [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo mount -t cifs -o guest //server1/share /mountpoint

        /etc/fstab: Use vim to add mount entry to bottom of /etc/fstab

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo vim /etc/fstab
        ...
        //server1/share  /mountpoint  cifs  guest  0 0

        To manually unmount the share, use umount with root privileges

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo umount /mountpoint
Authentication to SMB Shares

    Can flag SMB shares as non-browsable

        Clients such as smbclient will not display them

        Can still access shares by explicitly specifying share name during mount

    SMB servers typically restrict access to specific users, or groups of users

        Must present credentials to SMB server to access protected shares

        SMB server can use a wide range of authentication methods

        Common authentication choice is username and password pairs

            Can either be added to mount or /etc/fstab entry

            Can be stored in credentials file referenced during mount

        mount prompts for password if not provided

        Password must be provided if using /etc/fstab
        To explicitly request guest access, use guest



Authentication to SMB Shares

Example: Mount SMB share //server1/docs at /public/docs and attempt to authenticate as guest without password prompt

[student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo mount -t cifs -o guest //server1/docs /public/docs

Example: Mount SMB share //server1/cases at /bakerst/cases and attempt to authenticate as watson with password prompt

[student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo mount -t cifs -o username=watson //server1/cases /bakerst/cases

credentials offers better security

    Stores password in more secure file than /etc/fstab which is easily examined

    Place credentials somewhere with only root access, such as chmod 600

        Example: Mount SMB share //server1/sherlock at home/sherlock/work and attempt to authenticate using credentials stored in /secure/sherlock

        [student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo mount -t cifs -o credentials=/secure/sherlock //server1/sherlock /home/sherlock/work

Credentials file format:
username=username
password=password
domain=domain


Mount SMB Shares With Automounter

    Can configure automounter (autofs) to mount SMB shares on demand

        When process attempts to access file on SMB share

    Automounter unmounts share after certain period of inactivity

    Process to set up autofs on SMB share is essentially same as other automounts:

        If not already installed, install autofs

        Add auto.master.d configuration file

            Identifies base directory for shares and mapping file

        Create or edit mapping file to include mount details for SMB share

        Enable and start autofs

Mapping File

    To specify file system type, use -fstype=cifs followed by comma-separated list of mount options

        Use same options as mount

        Prefix server URI address with a : (colon)

    Example: Create an automount at /bakerst/cases for SMB share //server1/cases, and authenticate it against the /secure/sherlock credentials file

        /etc/auto.master.d/bakerst.autofs content:

        /bakerst   /etc/auto.bakerst

        /etc/auto.bakerst content:

        cases  -fstype=cifs,credentials=/secure/sherlock  ://server1/cases

        /secure/sherlock content (owned by root, perms 600):

        username=sherlock
        password=violin221B
        domain=BAKERST

autofs enable and start:

[student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo systemctl enable autofs
[student@desktop1 ~]$ sudo systemctl start autofs

For more info, see the following man pages: mount(8), umount(8), fstab(5), mount.cifs(8), smbclient(1), autofs(5), automount(8), and auto.master(5).
