netfilter

    Linux kernel includes netfilter subsystem

    Allows kernel modules to inspect incoming, outgoing and forwarded packets

    Can modify, drop, or reject packets in programmatic way before reaching user space components

    Main building block for firewall on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7

    Other programs interact with netfilter, such as:

        iptables

        ip6tables for IPv6

        ebtables for software bridges

firewalld

    New method of interacting with netfilter

    System daemon can configure and monitor system firewall rules

    Applications can request ports to be opened using DBus messaging system

        Feature can be disabled or locked down

    Covers IPv4, IPv6, and potentially ebtables settings

    Install package part of basic install

        Not part of minimal install

    Classifies and diverts network traffic into zones

        Zones have own firewall rules

        Zones have own list of ports and services to be opened or closed

    Can use NetworkManager for machines that regularly change networks
    Customize zone rules for each connection

    firewalld checks source address of every incoming packet

        If source address is tied to specific zone, zone’s rules are parsed

        If source address is not tied to zone, uses zone for incoming network interface

            If network interface is not tied to a zone, uses default zone

    Default zone is not separate zone

        It is another zone specified as default

        public zone is used by default

        System admin can change default zone

    Most zones permit traffic which matches specific ports/protocols ("631/udp") or predefined services ("ssh")

        Non-matching traffic is rejected

        Trusted zone is one exception

            Permits all traffic by default

trusted
    

Allow all incoming traffic.

home
    

Reject incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic or matching the ssh, mdns, ipp-client, samba-client, or dhcpv6-client predefined services.

internal
    

Reject incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic or matching the ssh, mdns, ipp-client, samba-client, or dhcpv6-client predefined services (same as the home zone to start with).

work
    

Reject incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic or matching the ssh, ipp-client, or dhcpv6-client predefined services.

public
    

Reject incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic or matching the ssh or dhcpv6-client predefined services. The default zone for newly-added network interfaces.

external
    

Reject incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic or matching the ssh predefined service. Outgoing IPv4 traffic forwarded through this zone is masqueraded to look like it originated from the IPv4 address of the outgoing network interface.

dmz
    

Reject incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic or matching the ssh predefined service.

block
    

Reject all incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic.

drop
    

Drop all incoming traffic unless related to outgoing traffic. Do not even respond with ICMP errors.


Predefined Services

ssh
    

Local SSH server. Traffic to 22/tcp.

dhcpv6-client
    

Local DHCPv6 client. Traffic to 546/udp on the fe80::/64 IPv6 network.

ipp-client
    

Local IPP printing. Traffic to 631/udp.

samba-client
    

Local Windows file and print sharing client. Traffic to 137/udp and 138/udp.

mdns
    

Multicast DNS (mDNS) local-link name resolution. Traffic to 5353/udp to the 224.0.0.251 (IPv4) or ff02::fb (IPv6) multicast addresses.
    

    To see a complete list of predefined services, use firewall-cmd --get-services

    Configuration files that define which services are included in firewalld package are in /usr/lib/firewalld/services

        Format defined by firewalld.zone(5)

    System administrators new to firewalld should either:

        Use predefined services

        Explicitly specify port/protocol to permit

    To review predefined services and define additional services, use firewall-config graphical tool


Firewall Configuration Methods

    Directly edit configuration files in /etc/firewalld/

    Use graphical firewall-config tool

    Use firewall-cmd from command line

firewall-config

    Graphical tool for altering and inspecting firewalld configuration

        Supports running, in-memory configuration

        Supports persistent, on-disk configuration

    Install firewall-config tool from firewall-config package

    Launch in two ways:

        From command line as firewall-config

        From Applications menu under Applications → Sundry → Firewall

    Prompts unprivileged users for root password to continue

firewall-cmd

    Command-line client to interact with firewalld

    Install with main firewalld package

    Can perform same actions as firewall-config


firewall-cmd

--get-default-zone
    

Query the current default zone.

--set-default-zone=<ZONE>
    

Set the default zone. This changes both the runtime and the permanent configuration.

--get-zones
    

List all available zones.

--get-active-zones
    

List all zones currently in use (have an interface or source tied to them), along with their interface and source information.

--add-source=<CIDR> [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

Route all traffic coming from the IP address or network/netmask <CIDR> to the specified zone. If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--remove-source=<CIDR> [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

Remove the rule routing all traffic coming from the IP address or network/netmask <CIDR> from the specified zone. If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--add-interface=<INTERFACE> [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

Route all traffic coming from <INTERFACE> to the specified zone. If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--change-interface=<INTERFACE> [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

Associate the interface with <ZONE> instead of its current zone. If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--list-all [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

List all configured interfaces, sources, services, and ports for <ZONE>. If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--list-all-zones
    

Retrieve all information for all zones. (Interfaces, sources, ports, services, etc.)

--add-service=<SERVICE> [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

Allow traffic to <SERVICE>. If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--add-port=<PORT/PROTOCOL> [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

Allow traffic to the <PORT/PROTOCOL> port(s). If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--remove-service=<SERVICE> [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

Remove <SERVICE> from the allowed list for the zone. If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--remove-port=<PORT/PROTOCOL> [--zone=<ZONE>]
    

Remove the <PORT/PROTOCOL> port(s) from the allowed list for the zone. If no --zone= option is provided, the default zone will be used.

--reload
    

Drop the runtime configuration and apply the persistent configuration.

root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=dmz
[root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-source=192.168.0.0/24
[root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --zone=internal --add-service=mysql
[root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload
