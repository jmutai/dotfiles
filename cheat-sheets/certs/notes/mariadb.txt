Relational Databases

    Relational database: Allows persistence of data in organized way

    Stores data items organized as set of tables

        Table represents entity

        Row corresponds to record

        Column corresponds to attribute

ackages Included

    PostgreSQL: Open source database developed by PostgreSQL Global Development Group

        Consists of Postgres users, companies, volunteers

        Supervised by companies like Red Hat and EnterpriseDB

    MariaDB: Community-developed branch of MySQL built authors of MySQL

        Offers feature enhancements including alternate storage engines, server optimizations, patches

        MariaDB Foundation works closely with user/developer community

MariaDB and MySQL

    MariaDB: Community-developed replacement for MySQL

        MySQL not shipped in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 core toolset

    /etc/my.cnf file has default configurations for MariaDB

        Data directory

        Socket bindings

        Log and error file location

    Instead of adding new configurations to /etc/my.cnf, can add *.cnf file to /etc/my.cnf.d/ directory holding MariaDB configuration


Demonstration

    Install MariaDB on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# yum groupinstall mariadb mariadb-client -y

    Start MariaDB service on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl start mariadb

        The default MariaDB log file is /var/log/mariadb/mariadb.log. Look there first when troubleshooting MariaDB.

    Enable MariaDB service to start at boot on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl enable mariadb

    Verify status of service on server1:

    [root@server1 ~]# systemctl status mariadb

        status reports some attributes:

            Loaded: Shows if service is loaded and enabled

            Active: Shows if service is activated

            Main PID: Shows main process ID from service

            CGroup: Shows all processes that belong to service

        If database is stopped, status reports last known PID and that service is inactive


Improve MariaDB Installation Security

    MariaDB provides program to improve security from install state

    Run mysql_secure_installation without arguments:

    [root@server1 ~]# mysql_secure_installation

    Improves MariaDB security by:

        Setting password for root accounts

        Removing root accounts accessible from outside local host

        Removing anonymous-user accounts

        Removing test database

    Script fully interactive

    Prompts for each step in process

MariaDB and Networking
Local Access

    Security greatly improved

        Records accessed by applications on same server only

    May have performance impact

        Server shares resources with other services

Remote Access

    Safety decreases

        Another port opened on server, may result in attack

    Server performance increases

        No sharing of resources

    Default: Server listens for TCP/IP connections on available interfaces on port 3306

        No users have remote access permission


MariaDB network configuration directives are in /etc/my.cnf under [mysqld]

bind-address
    

    Server listens based on this directive

    Can enter only one of these values:

        Host name

        IPv4 address

        IPv6 address

    To connect to all available addresses (IPv6 and IPv4), set to ::

    To connect to all IPv4 addresses, leave blank or set to 0.0.0.0

    /etc/my.cnf can have only one bind-address entry

    On system with multiple addresses, can select either one or all addresses

skip-networking
    

    If set to 1, server listens for local clients only

    Interaction with server through socket

        Default location: /var/lib/mysql/mysql.sock

        Can change with socket value in /etc/my.cnf

    If shutting off networking this way:

        Disables connections via localhost

        MySQL client can still make local connections through socket file

port
    

    Port to listen on for TCP/IP connections

    For remote access, need to modify firewall

    To add service:

    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=mysql
    [root@server1 ~]# firewall-cmd --reload

    

For more info on configuring MariaDB databases, see:

    mysql_secure_installation(1), mysql.server(1), and mysqld_selinux(8) man pages

    Red Hat Software Collections documentation at https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Software_Collections/

    mariadb-client installation provides mysql program

        Lets you connect to local or remote MariaDB database server

        [root@server1 ~]# mysql -u root -h localhost -p

Creating a Database

List Databases

    Database in MariaDB implemented as directory

    Default installation has four databases

    To list databases:

    MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW DATABASES;
    +--------------------+
    | Database           |
    +--------------------+
    | information_schema |
    | mysql              |
    | performance_schema |
    | test               |
    +--------------------+
    4 rows in set (0.01 sec)

    Can delete test default database only

Case Sensitivity

    MariaDB not case-sensitive for simple commands

        show databases; = SHOW DATABASES; = ShOw DATAbases;

    Table and database names case-sensitive

    Many databases use all lowercase for database names

    Common to use uppercase for commands

        Differentiates command itself from target

    Important part is to terminate command with ;

Create Database

    To create new database:

    MariaDB [(none)]> CREATE DATABASE inventory;

    To connect to or to switch between databases:

    MariaDB [(none)]> USE inventory;

List Tables

    MariaDB can have multiple tables per database

    To list tables:

    MariaDB [(none)]>  USE mysql;
    MariaDB [(none)]>  SHOW TABLES;

List Attributes

    To list attributes (column names) from table:

    MariaDB [(mysql)]>  DESCRIBE servers;

Using SQL

    Structured Query Language (SQL): Programming language for managing data in relational databases

    Common SQL commands:

        insert

        update

        delete

        select

    Often referred to as CRUD operations:

        Create (insert)

        Read (select)

        Update (update)

        Delete (delete)

nsert Data

    To insert data into table, first determine tables attributes:

    MariaDB [(inventory)]>  DESCRIBE product;
    +-----------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | Field           | Type         | Null | Key | Default | Extra          |
    +-----------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    | id              | int(11)      | NO   | PRI | NULL    | auto_increment |
    | name            | varchar(100) | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    | price           | double       | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    | stock           | int(11)      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    | id_category     | int(11)      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    | id_manufacturer | int(11)      | NO   |     | NULL    |                |
    +-----------------+--------------+------+-----+---------+----------------+
    6 rows in set (0.00 sec)

        Example: All attributes required to insert new product:

        MariaDB [(inventory)]>  INSERT INTO product \\ 
                            (name,price,stock,id_category,id_manufacturer) \\ 
                            VALUES ('SDSSDP-128G-G25 2.5',82.04,30,3,1); \\ 
        Query OK, 1 row affected (0.00 sec)

        Attribute ID not specified, although required

        Because column is marked auto_increment, MariaDB automatically assigns sequential value for column when inserting new record
Delete a Record

    To delete record:

    MariaDB [(inventory)]>  DELETE FROM product WHERE id = 1 ;
    Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

    If WHERE clause not specified, all records in table are erased

        Database equivalent of rm -rf /

Update a Record

    To update record:

    MariaDB [(inventory)]>  UPDATE product SET price=89.90, stock=60 WHERE id = 5 ;
     Query OK, 1 row affected (0.01 sec)

    If WHERE clause not specified, all records are updated

Read Data Records

    To read data records from database:

    MariaDB [(inventory)]>  SELECT name,price,stock FROM product;
    +---------------------+--------+-------+
    | name                | price  | stock |
    +---------------------+--------+-------+
    | ThinkServer TS140   | 539.88 |    20 |
    | RT-AC68U            | 219.99 |    10 |
    | X110 64GB           |  73.84 |   100 |
    | SDSSDP-128G-G25 2.5 |  82.04 |    30 |
    +---------------------+--------+-------+
    4 rows in set (0.00 sec)


Select All Attributes

    To select all attributes, use *:

    MariaDB [(inventory)]>  SELECT * FROM product;
    +----+---------------------+--------+-------+-------------+-----------------+
    | id | name                | price  | stock | id_category | id_manufacturer |
    +----+---------------------+--------+-------+-------------+-----------------+
    |  2 | ThinkServer TS140   | 539.88 |    20 |           2 |               4 |
    |  3 | RT-AC68U            | 219.99 |    10 |           1 |               3 |
    |  4 | X110 64GB           |  73.84 |   100 |           3 |               1 |
    |  5 | SDSSDP-128G-G25 2.5 |  82.04 |    30 |           3 |               1 |
    +----+---------------------+--------+-------+-------------+-----------------+
    4 rows in set (0.00 sec)


Filter Results

    To filter results, use WHERE clause:

    MariaDB [(inventory)]>  SELECT * FROM product WHERE price > 100;
    +----+-------------------+--------+-------+-------------+-----------------+
    | id | name              | price  | stock | id_category | id_manufacturer |
    +----+-------------------+--------+-------+-------------+-----------------+
    |  2 | ThinkServer TS140 | 539.88 |    20 |           2 |               4 |
    |  3 | RT-AC68U          | 219.99 |    10 |           1 |               3 |
    +----+-------------------+--------+-------+-------------+-----------------+
    2 rows in set (0.00 sec)

Creating User Accounts With MariaDB

    Default: MariaDB handles authentication/authorization through user table in mysql database

        Root password for database persisted in user table, not operating system

    Recent versions of MariaDB can use PAM for authentication

    To create new account, use CREATE USER

        Creates new row in mysql.user table with no privileges

    information_schema and test database allow some privileges for all users

        Main reason why test database deleted

    To create user:

        Connected user must have CREATE USER or INSERT privilege for mysql


Account Names

    Account names specified as 'user_name'@'host_name'

    Can create multiple user accounts with same name but different privileges according to source host

    MariaDB [(none)]>  CREATE USER mobius@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'redhat';


Account Properties

    Passwords encrypted in user table:

    MariaDB [mysql]> SELECT host,user,password FROM user WHERE user = 'mobius';
    +-----------+--------+-------------------------------------------+
    | host      | user   | password                                  |
    +-----------+--------+-------------------------------------------+
    | localhost | mobius | *84BB5DF4823DA319BBF86C99624479A198E6EEE9 |
    +-----------+--------+-------------------------------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)

    Before granting any privileges, access denied for almost any action:

    [root@server1 ~]# mysql -u mobius -p
    Enter password: redhat
    MariaDB [(none)]> create database inventory;
    ERROR 1044 (42000): Access denied for user 'mobius'@'localhost' to database 'inventory'

        If host name not provided, assumed to be "%"

        Means user can access from any source host

mobius@localhost
    

User mobius can connect just from localhost

mobius@192.168.1.5
    

User mobius can connect from 192.168.1.5 host

mobius@192.168.1.%
    

User mobius can connect from any host that belongs to network 192.168.1.0

mobius@%
    

User mobius can connect from any host

mobius@2000:472:18:b51:c32:a21
    

User mobius can connect from 2000:472:18:b51:c32:a21 host


Granting and Revoking Account Privileges
Privileges

    Privileges: Permissions user may have within MariaDB

    Organized as:

Global
    

CREATE USER, SHOW DATABASES
    

Administer database server

Database
    

CREATE
    

Create work with databases on server at high level

Table
    

CRUD commands
    

Create tables and manipulate database data

Column
        

Grant table-like command usage on a column (generally rare)

Other
        

More granular privileges, discussed in detail in MariaDB documentation


GRANT Statement

    To grant privileges to accounts, use GRANT statement

    Connected user must have GRANT OPTION privilege

    Users can grant privileges they have already been granted only

        Example: mobius cannot grant SELECT privileges on database table unless mobius has both:

            SELECT privilege

            GRANT OPTION table privilege

            [root@server1 ~]# mysql -u mobius -p
            Enter password: redhat
            MariaDB [(none)]> use inventory;
            MariaDB [(inventory)]> select * from category;
            ERROR 1142 (42000): SELECT command denied to user 'mobius'@'localhost' for table 'category'
            MariaDB [(inventory)]> exit
            [root@server1 ~]# mysql -u root -p
            Enter password: redhat
            MariaDB [(none)]> use inventory;
            MariaDB [(inventory)]> GRANT SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT on inventory.category to mobius@localhost;
            Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)
            MariaDB [(inventory)]> exit
            [root@server1 ~]# mysql -u mobius -p
            Enter password: redhat
            MariaDB [(none)]> use inventory;
            MariaDB [(inventory)]> select * from category;
            +----+------------+
            | id | name       |
            +----+------------+
            |  1 | Networking |
            |  2 | Servers    |
            |  3 | Ssd        |
            +----+------------+
            3 rows in set (0.00 sec)


GRANT SELECT ON database.table TO username@hostname
    

Grant select privilege for specific table in specific database to specific user

GRANT SELECT ON database.* TO username@hostname
    

Grant select privilege for all tables in specific database to specific user

GRANT SELECT ON *.* TO username@hostname
    

Grant select privilege for all tables in all databases to specific user

GRANT CREATE, ALTER, DROP ON database.* to username@hostname
    

Grant privilege to create, alter, and drop tables in specific database to specific user.

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* to username@hostname
    

Grant all available privileges for all databases to specific user, effectively creating a superuser, similar to root.


Granting and Revoking Account Privileges
REVOKE Statement

    To revoke privileges from accounts, use REVOKE statement

    Connected user must have both:

        GRANT OPTION privilege

        Privileges being revoked

        MariaDB [(none)]> REVOKE SELECT, UPDATE, DELETE, INSERT on inventory.category from mobius@localhost;
        Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.00 sec)

    After granting or revoking privilege, reload all privileges from privileges tables in mysql database:

    MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


SHOW GRANTS FOR

    To revoke privileges, need list of privileges granted to user

    To provide list, use SHOW GRANTS FOR username;:

    MariaDB [(none)]> SHOW GRANTS FOR root@localhost;
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | Grants for root@localhost                                           |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION |
    | GRANT PROXY ON ''@'' TO 'root'@'localhost' WITH GRANT OPTION        |
    +---------------------------------------------------------------------+
    2 rows in set (0.00 sec)


DROP USER

    To delete user from database when no longer required, use DROP USER username;

        username should use same 'user'@'host' format as CREATE USER

    If account being dropped is currently connected, account not deleted until connection is closed

        Connection does not close automatically


Troubleshooting Database Access
User has been granted access to connect from any host, but can only connect on localhost using mysql (applications he or she uses cannot connect, even on localhost)
    

Remove skip-networking directive from my.cnf and restart service

User can connect with any application on localhost, but not remotely.
    

    Check bind-address configuration in my.cnf to ensure database is accessible

    Ensure user table includes entry for user from host from which user is trying to connect

User can connect, but cannot see any database other than information_schema and test
    

    Common problem when user has just been created, as user has no privileges by default but can connect and use default databases

    Add grants for database user requires

User can connect, but cannot create any databases
    

Grant user global CREATE privilege (also grants DROP privileges)

User can connect, but cannot read or write any data
    

Grant user CRUD privileges only for database he or she will be using

Creating a Backup

    Important to back up MariaDB databases

    Database often contains company mission-critical data

    Backups let you recover data after:

        Operating system crash

        Power failure

        File system crash

        Hardware problem

        Security breach

        Database corruption

        Data poisoning


Ways to Back Up

    Two ways to back up MariaDB:

        Logical backups: Export information/records in plain text files

        Physical (raw) backups: Contains copies of files/directories that store content

Logical Backup Characteristics

    Retrieve database structure by querying database

    Highly portable

    Can be restored to another database provider in some cases

    Slower backup

        Server must access database information and convert it to logical format

    Performed while server is online

    Backups do not include log/configuration files



Physical Backup Characteristics

    Consist of raw copies of database directories/folders

    Output more compact

    Backups can include log/configuration files

    Portable only to machines with similar hardware/software

    Faster backup

    Should be performed while either:

        Server is offline

        All tables in database are locked

            Prevents changes during backup


Performing a Logical Backup

    To do a logical backup, use mysqldump:

    [root@server1 ~]# mysqldump -u root -p inventory > /backup/inventory.dump

    To logically back up all databases, use --all-databases:

    [root@server1 ~]# mysqldump -u root -p --all-databases > /backup/mariadb.dump


Logical Backup Output

    Logical backup output appears as series of SQL statements

        Example: Snippet from dump of mysql:
mysqldump requires at least:

    Select privilege for dumped tables

    SHOW VIEW for dumped views

    TRIGGER for dumped triggers

--add-drop-tables
    

Tells MariaDB to add DROP TABLE statement before each CREATE TABLE statement

--no-data
    

Dumps database structure only, not contents

--lock-all-tables
    

    Cannot insert new record anywhere in database while copy is finished

    Option very important to ensure backup integrity

--add-drop-databases
    

Tells MariaDB to add DROP DATABASE statement before each CREATE DATABASE statement

    Tools available to perform physical backups:

        ibbackup

        cp

        mysqlhotcopy

        lvm

    MariaDB physical backup task can use benefits of LVM snapshots

    Key benefit: Very quick, keeps database downtime short

        Supports putting database files on dedicated LVM partition


Steps 1-3

    Verify where MariaDB files are stored:

    [root@server1 ~]# mysqladmin variables | grep datadir
    | datadir                         | /var/lib/mysql/             |

    Verify which logical volume hosts location:

        Example: Volume group is vg0, logical volume name is mariadb

        [root@server1 ~]# df /var/lib/mysql
        Filesystem              1K-blocks    Used Available Use% Mounted on
        /dev/mapper/vg0-mariadb  51475068 7320316  41516928  15% /var/lib/mysql             |

    Verify space available for snapshot:

        Example: 61.29 GB available

        [root@server1 ~]# vgdisplay vg0 | grep Free
        Free  PE / Size       15321 / 61.29 GB            |


Steps 4-5

    Connect to MariaDB, flush tables to disk, and lock them

        Alternatively, shut down mariadb service

        Important step, prevents new records being inserted into database while snapshot is created

        [root@server1 ~]# mysql -u root -p
        MariaDB [(none)]> FLUSH TABLES WITH READ LOCK;

        Do not close session

        Lock lifts as soon as client disconnects

        Database must remained locked until LVM snapshot is created

    In another terminal, create LVM snapshot:

        Snapshot must be large enough to hold backup

        [root@server1 ~]# lvcreate -L20G -s -n mariadb-backup /dev/vg0/mariadb           |

=== ch08s06 → m24s54_MariaDB_Backups_Perform_Physical_4-5

Connect to MariaDB, flush the tables to disk, and lock them (alternatively, shut down the mariadb service):

This step is very important so that no new records are inserted into the database while the snapshot is created.
    Do not close this session. As soon as the client disconnects, this lock is lifted. The database must remained locked until the LVM snapshot is created.

In another terminal session, create the LVM snapshot:


Steps 6-9

    In original MariaDB session, unlock tables:

        Alternatively, bring mariadb service up

        MariaDB [(none)]> UNLOCK TABLES;

    Mount snapshot at arbitrary location:

    [root@server1 ~]# mkdir /mnt/snapshot
    [root@server1 ~]# mount /dev/vg0/mariadb-backup /mnt/snapshot

    Use standard file system backup to store copy of /var/lib/mysql as mounted under /mnt/snapshot

    After backup, be sure to delete snapshot:

    [root@server1 ~]# umount /mnt/snapshot
    [root@server1 ~]# lvremove /dev/vg0/mariadb-backup



Restoring a Backup
Logical Restore

    To do a logical restore, use mysql:

    [root@server1 ~]# mysql -u root -p  inventory  < /backup/mariadb.dump

Physical Restore

    To do a physical restore, stop mariadb service:

    [root@server1 ~]#  systemctl stop mariadb

    Verify where MariaDB files are stored:

    [root@server1 ~]# mysqladmin variables | grep datadir
    | datadir                         | /var/lib/mysql/             |

    Remove actual content:

    [root@server1 ~]# rm -rf /var/lib/mysql/*

    Use standard file system restore to restore copy from backup to /var/lib/mysql
