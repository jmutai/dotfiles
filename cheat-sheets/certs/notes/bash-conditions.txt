        Using Conditional Structures



    Using Bash Special Variables
    Positional Parameters

        Predefined variables that store value of command-line arguments

        Named numerically:

            0 refers to script name

            1 is predefined with value of first script argument

            2 contains second argument, and so on

        Values referenced with syntax (, [, etc.

        When referencing values past the ninth positional parameter, the brace-quoted form of variable expansion must be used. For example, the value of the tenth positional argument must be referenced with the syntax ${10} rather than (0. Otherwise, Bash expands the ( in (0 to the value of the first positional argument to the script.

        Special variables refer to positional parameters: $* and $@

            When $* is used, all arguments are seen as single word

            When $@ is used, each argument is seen as separate word

            [student@server1 bin]$ cat showargs
            #!/bin/bash

            for ARG in "$*"; do
                echo $ARG
            done

            [student@server1 bin]$ ./showargs 1 2 3
            1 2 3

            [student@server1 bin]$ cat showargs
            #!/bin/bash

            for ARG in "$@"; do
                echo $ARG
            done

            [student@server1 bin]$ ./showargs 1 2 3
            1
            2
            3


        $# represents number of command-line arguments passed to a script

        Can be used to verify whether any arguments, or correct number of arguments, are passed to script

        [student@server1 bin]$ cat countargs
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "There are $# arguments."

        [student@server1 bin]$ ./countargs
        There are 0 arguments.

        [student@server1 bin]$ ./countargs 1 2 3
        There are 3 arguments.


    Exit Status

        Every command returns exit status

            Also called return status or exit code

        Successful command exits with status 0

        Unsuccessful commands exit with nonzero status

        Exit status is passed to parent process and stored in ? variable

        Display value of $? to retrieve exit status of executed command


    [student@server1 bin]$
    ls /etc/hosts

    /etc/hosts

    [student@server1 bin]$ echo $?
    0

    [student@server1 bin]$ ls /etc/nofile
    ls: cannot access /etc/nofile: No such file or directory

    [student@server1 bin]$ echo $?
    2

    [student@server1 bin]$ grep localhost /etc/hosts
    127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
    ::1         localhost localhost.localdomain localhost6 localhost6.localdomain6

    [student@server1 bin]$ echo $?
    0

    [student@server1 bin]$ grep random /etc/hosts

    [student@server1 bin]$ echo $?
    1


    Using Exit Codes

        Script exits when it has processed its contents

        May want script to exit part way through, such as when error occurs

        When script encounters exit, it immediately stops processing and exits

        Can execute`exit` with optional integer argument between 0 and 255 (exit code)

            0 represents no error

            Nonzero values indicate error

                Use different nonzero values to differentiate error types

        Exit code is passed back to parent process and stored in ? variable

        To retrieve value, use $?

        If exit is used without argument, script exits and passes exit status of last command executed

        [student@server1 bin]$ cat hello
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Hello, world"
        exit 0

        [student@server1 bin]$ ./hello
        Hello, world

        [student@server1 bin]$ echo $?
        0

        [student@server1 bin]$ cat hello
        #!/bin/bash
        echo "Hello, world"
        exit 1

        [student@server1 bin]$ ./hello
        Hello, world

        [student@server1 bin]$ echo $?
        1

    Testing Script Inputs

        To perform integrity checking, use test

            Can also use newer extended test command syntax [[ <TESTEXPRESSION> ]]

    Upon completion, test produces exit code stored as $?

    Exit status 0 indicates test passed, and nonzero values indicate failure

Testing Script Inputs
Performing Comparison Tests

    Comparison test expressions use binary operators

    Operators expect object on each side of operator and evaluate objects for equality and inequality

    [ <ITEM1> <BINARY COMPARISON OPERATOR> <ITEM2> ]

    Bash uses different operators for string and numeric comparisons

    Binary numeric comparison is limited to integers

Testing Script Inputs

Operator
    

Meaning
    

Example

-eq

is equal to

[ "$a" -eq "$b" ]

-ne

is not equal to
    

[ "$a" -ne "$b" ]

-gt
    

is greater than

[ "$a" -gt "$b" ]

-ge
    
is greater than or equal to
    

[ "$a" -ge "$b" ]

-lt
    
is less than
    

[ "$a" -lt "$b" ]

-le

is less than or equal to

[ "$a" -le "$b" ]


Example Numeric Comparison Operators

[student@server1 ~]$ [ 1 -eq 1 ]; echo $?
0
[student@server1 ~]$ [ 1 -ne 1 ]; echo $?
1
[student@server1 ~]$ [ 8 -gt 2 ]; echo $?
0
[student@server1 ~]$ [ 2 -ge 2 ]; echo $?
0
[student@server1 ~]$ [ 2 -lt 2 ]; echo $?
1
[student@server1 ~]$ [ 1 -lt 2 ]; echo $?
0

    String comparison uses following binary operators
=
    

is equal to
    

[ "$a" = "$b" ]

==
    

is equal to
    

[ "$a" == "$b" ]

!=
    

is not equal to
    

[ "$a" != "$b" ]

    Examples of Bash’s string comparison operators

    [student@server1 ~]$ [ abc = abc ]; echo $?
    0
    [student@server1 ~]$ [ abc == def ]; echo $?
    1
    [student@server1 ~]$ [ abc != def ]; echo $?
    0

Unary Operators

    Bash also has unary operators for string evaluation

    Unary operators evaluate just one item

    [ <UNARY OPERATOR> <ITEM> ]

    Unary operators for string evaluation

-z
    

string is zero length (null)
    

[ -z "$a" ]

-n
    

string is not null
    

[ -n "$a" ]

    Examples of string unary operators

    [student@server1 ~]$ STRING=''; [ -z "$STRING" ]; echo $?
    0
    [student@server1 ~]$ STRING='abc'; [ -n "$STRING" ]; echo $?
    0

esting Files and Directories

    Test script interactions with external entities, such as files and directories

-b
    

File exists and is block special
    

[ -b <FILE> ]

-c
    

File exists and is character special
    

[ -c <FILE> ]

-d
    

File exists and is a directory
    

[ -d <DIRECTORY> ]

-e
    

File exists
    

[ -e <FILE> ]

-f
    

File is a regular file
    

[ -f <FILE> ]

-L
    

File exists and is a symbolic link
    

[ -L <FILE> ]

-r
    

File exists and read permission is granted
    

[ -r <FILE> ]

-s
    

File exists and has a size greater than zero
    

[ -s <FILE> ]

-w
    

File exists and write permission is granted
    

[ -w <FILE> ]

-x
    

File exists and execute (or search) permission is granted
    

[ -x <FILE> ]

-ef
    

FILE1 has the same device and inode number as FILE2
    

[ <FILE1> -ef <FILE2> ]

-nt
    

FILE1 has newer modification date than FILE2
    

[ <FILE1> -nt <FILE2> ]

-ot
    

FILE1 has older modification date than FILE2
    

[ <FILE1> -ot <FILE2> ]

    Space character is required in these locations:

        Inside test expression brackets

        To separate elements within test expression

Logical AND OR Operators

    Use logical AND operator && to test if both of two conditions are true

    Use logical OR operator || to test if either of two conditions is true

    [student@server1 ~]$ [ 2 -gt 1 ] && [ 1 -gt 0 ]; echo $?
    0
    [student@server1 ~]$ [ 2 -gt 1 ] && [ 1 -gt 2 ]; echo $?
    1
    [student@server1 ~]$ [ 2 -gt 1 ] || [ 1 -gt 2 ]; echo $?
    0
    [student@server1 ~]$ [ 0 -gt 1 ] || [ 1 -gt 2 ]; echo $?



Using Conditional Structures

    Simple shell scripts are a series of commands that execute from beginning to end

    Adding conditional structures allows scripts to incorporate decision-making

        Portions of script execute only when certain conditions are met



if/then Statement

    Simplest conditional structure

    if <CONDITION>; then
          <STATEMENT>
          ...
          <STATEMENT>
        fi

    If condition is met, action is taken

    Numeric, string, and file tests are frequently used as conditions in if/then statements

        Example: Use if/then statement to start psacct service if it is not active

        systemctl is-active psacct > /dev/null 2>&1

        if  [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          systemctl start psacct
        fi


if/then/else Statement

    Different actions are taken based on whether condition is met

    if <CONDITION>; then
          <STATEMENT>
          ...
          <STATEMENT>
        else
          <STATEMENT>
          ...
          <STATEMENT>
    fi

        Example: Use if/then/else to start psacct service if it is not active and stop it if it is active

        systemctl is-active psacct > /dev/null 2>&1

        if  [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
          systemctl start psacct
        else
          systemctl stop psacct
        fi


if/then/elif/then/else Statement

    To test multiple conditions, use elif (ELSE IF)

    Bash tests conditions in order

    Upon finding true condition:

        Bash executes actions associated with condition

        Bash skips remainder of conditional structure

    If no conditions is true, Bash executes else actions

    if <CONDITION>; then
          <STATEMENT>
          ...
          <STATEMENT>
        elif <CONDITION>; then
          <STATEMENT>
          ...
          <STATEMENT>
        else
          <STATEMENT>
          ...
          <STATEMENT>
        fi


    Example: Use if/then/elif/then/else statement to:

        Run mysql client if mariadb is active

        Run psql client if postgresql is active

        Or, run sqlite3 client if both mariadb and postgresql are not active

        systemctl is-active mariadb > /dev/null 2>&1
        MARIADB_ACTIVE=$?
        systemctl is-active postgresql > /dev/null 2>&1
        POSTGRESQL_ACTIVE=$?

        if  [ "$MARIADB_ACTIVE" -eq 0 ]; then
          mysql
        elif  [ "$POSTGRESQL_ACTIVE" -eq 0 ]; then
          psql
        else
          sqlite3
        fi



Case Statement

    if/then/elif/then/else statement can have as many elif clauses as needed

    Statement and logic become harder to read and understand

    For complex situations, use case statements

    case <VALUE> in
       <PATTERN1>)
           <STATEMENT>
           ...
           <STATEMENT>
           ;;
       <PATTERN2>)
           <STATEMENT>
           ...
           <STATEMENT>
           ;;
    esac


    case statement attempts to match <VALUE> to each <PATTERN> in order, one by one

        When pattern matches, code segment associated with pattern is executed

            ;; indicates end of block

        All other patterns are skipped and case statement is exited

        Can add as many pattern/statement blocks as needed

    To mimic behavior of else in if/then/elif/then/else, use * as final pattern

    Because * matches anything, it executes a set of commands if no other patterns were matched

    case statements are widely used in init scripts

    case "(" in
       start)
           start
           ;;
       stop)
           rm -f $lockfile
           stop
           ;;
       restart)
           restart
           ;;
       reload)
           reload
           ;;
       status)
           status
           ;;
       *)
           echo "Usage: $0 (start|stop|restart|reload|status)"
           ;;
    esac

)





    case statements are widely used in init scripts

    case "(" in
       start)
           start
           ;;
       stop)
           rm -f $lockfile
           stop
           ;;
       restart)
           restart
           ;;
       reload)
           reload
           ;;
       status)
           status
           ;;
       *)
           echo "Usage: $0 (start|stop|restart|reload|status)"
           ;;
    esac

Using Conditional Structures

    If action is same for multiple patterns, can combine patterns to share action block

    To separate multiple patterns, use pipe character, |

    case "(" in
       ...
       reload|restart)
           restart
           ;;
       ...
    esac
