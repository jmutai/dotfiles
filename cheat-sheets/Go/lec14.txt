		// Pause the function for 1 second to allow other functions to execute
		time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 1000)

	// A go routine is a function that runs in parallel with other functions
	// We define one by using go followed by the function name
	
	for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
		go count(i) 
	}
	
	// Wait for the timer to make sure the go routine has time to 
	// finish otherwise the program would end before that happens
	time.Sleep(time.Millisecond * 11000)
